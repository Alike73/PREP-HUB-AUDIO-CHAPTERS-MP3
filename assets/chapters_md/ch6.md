INTRODUCTION

**Regulations** and **standards** impact every healthcare professional, including those working in the Sterile Processing department, the SPD. These regulations and standards establish minimum levels of quality and safety. When regulations and standards are not followed, the results can vary from legal consequences to poor patient outcomes.

This chapter will explain regulatory requirements that must be followed, as well as guidelines that are recommended.

-   **Regulation:** Rules issued by administrative agencies that have the force of law.
-   **Standard:** A uniform method of defining basic parameters for processes, products, services and measurements.

Industry, nonprofit organizations, trade associations and others develop standards. Generally, standards are not law; however, they may be incorporated into law by governmental bodies.

**SP technicians are affected by regulations and standards. SP technicians must be familiar with applicable regulations and standards for the following reasons:**

Regulations must be followed and failure to comply with them may result in legal consequences to the healthcare facility.

Regulations and standards may include workplace safety issues, which may help protect SP technicians from exposure to infectious agents and toxic substances.

Regulations and standards may include disinfection and sterilization practices.

With careful compliance with regulations and standards, patient safety is at its highest level of quality of care.

Regulations and standards are issued by federal, state and local governing agencies. Standards are also issued by professional organizations and provide significant assistance lo healthcare personnel because they are developed according to **best practice.**

-   **Best practice:** A method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved by other means.

REGULATORY AGENCIES

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the FD,A is responsible for ensuring that medical devices are safe and effective for patient care.

The FDA regulates the manufacture of all medical devices. It also regulates sterilant, high-level disinfectants, packaging materials, sterilizers, and quality monitors such as biological indicators (BIs).

Medical Device Classification

**The level of regulation placed on any device depends upon how the FDA classifies that device:**

**Class I devices:** Low-risk devices, such as most handheld surgical instruments, hospital beds and ultrasonic cleaners. These items are subject to general controls, which include registration and device listing, medical device reporting, and quality system regulation and labeling.

**Class II devices:** Devices considered to pose potential risks great enough to warrant a higher level of regulation. Class II devices include most types of sterilization equipment, BIs and chemical indicators CIs. Class II devices are usually subjected to performance standards, post market surveillance studies and specific guidelines or special labeling.

**Class III devices:** The most stringently regulated devices, including heart valves, pacemakers and other life-sustaining devices. Manufacturers of new Class III devices must obtain **premarket approval, or the PMA** from the FDA to demonstrate product safety and efficacy.

**Premarket approval, or the PMA, is** The FDAs process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices.

Premarket and Post market Requirements are FDAs regulations that help ensure medical devices are safe for patients and healthcare workers, including SP technicians; the agency requires the manufacturer to provide instructions for use the IFUs with the product. The IFU should contain detailed instructions on how to properly process and use the product. This includes disassembly, cleaning, assembly, disinfection and sterilization instructions.

**Medical Device Reporting Requirements**

Medical device reporting regulations require user facilities like hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes and outpatient treatment facilities to report suspected medical device-related deaths to the FDA and device manufacturers within 10 days of the event. User facilities must report medical device-related serious injuries only to the manufacturer within 10 days of the event. If the manufacturer is unknown, the injury should be reported to the FDA.

The FDA **MedWatch** program is designed for the voluntary reporting of device-related problems. It provides a vehicle by which healthcare facilities can notify the FDA about medical device malfunctions, labeling inadequacies and other problems, including inadequate IFU.

-   **Serious injury:** An injury or illness that is life­ threatening, resulting in permanent impairment of a bodily function or permanent damage to a body structure, or necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body structure.
-   **MedWatch: is** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's safety information and adverse event reporting system that serves healthcare professionals and the public by reporting serious problems suspected to be associated with the drugs and medical devices they prescribe, dispense or use.

In recent years, the FDA has used both voluntary and mandatory reporting programs to collect information about specific potential problems. Forms to report either voluntary or mandatory device issues may be obtained from the FDA

Medical Device Recalls

A recall is an action taken to address a problem with a medical device. This action can be initiated when a device is defective and/or poses a health risk. Recalls can be instituted voluntarily by the manufacturer, distributor or other interested party, or they can be mandated by the FDA. A recall does not always mean the affected product can no longer be used. Instead, it could mean that the product must be checked or repaired.

For example, if an implant, such as a pacemaker, is recalled, it may not have to be removed from the patient; however, the risks of the removal decision should be discussed with the patient. The FDA monitors all mandated recalls to ensure the actions taken by the manufacturer are adequate to protect the public.

There are three categories of FDA recalls:

-   **Class I, High Risk:** Means that there is a reasonable chance the product will cause serious health problems or death. The manufacturer must notify customers and direct them to notify the product recipients. The notification must include the name of the device being recalled, the lot or serial numbers, the reason for the recall, and instructions to correct, avoid or minimize the problem. The manufacturer must also issue a press release to notify the public. In addition, the FDA may issue its own press release or public health notice.
-   **Class II, Less Serious Risk:** Means that there is a possibility that the product will cause a temporary or medically reversible adverse health problem, or there is a remote chance that the device will cause serious health problems. The manufacturer must notify customers and sometimes ask them to inform the product's recipients. Generally, neither the FDA nor the manufacturer issues a press release.
-   **Class III, Low Risk:** Means that the use of a product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. The manufacturer must notify customers, and neither the FDA nor the manufacturer will issue a press release.

Note: Be careful not to confuse FDA medical device classes with the FDA recall classes. FDA recall Class I is the most stringent recall whereas the medical device Class I is the least stringent category.

FDA Labeling Document

The FDA has expressed concern about the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases caused by improperly reprocessed medical devices. The FDA released a document, Labeling Reusable Medical Devices for Reprocessing in Healthcare Facilities, which requires manufacturers to comply with certain criteria-mostly involving reprocessing instructions-when they submit medical device applications to the FDA for evaluation. The FDA holds both the manufacturer and user responsible for safe and effective reprocessing of medical devices. This is because reprocessing requires the manufacturer to provide IFU that the healthcare facility must follow.

**The manufacturer is responsible for:**

Supporting the claim of reuse with adequate labeling and complete reprocessing instructions.

The validation and documentation of tests, which show that the instructions are adequate and can be reasonably executed by users.

Users are responsible for confirming they have the facilities and equipment to execute the instructions and ensuring the instructions are followed.

FDA Enforcement Requirements for Healthcare Facilities Reprocessing Single-Use Devices

The FDA requires anyone who processes single-use devices to obtain and comply with FDA 5 l0k directives to reprocess SUDs.

To obtain approval, the facility must prove it can properly clean and sterilize the product to the original manufacturer's standards each time the product is reprocessed. The facility must also show it is able to test the product to prove the standards have been met in all reprocessing areas, including decontamination, disinfection and sterilization.

Emergency Use Authorization

Emergency Use Authorization or EUA allows the FDA to help strengthen the nation's public health protections against chemical and biological threats, including infectious diseases, and other threats, *by* facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during public health emergencies.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, EUA was implemented to decontaminate some SUDs, like N95 face masks, because they were a critical item used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and were in short supply.

The EUA is only authorized during a designated time-period. Once the FDA has deemed that the emergency or shortage has ended, the EUA is removed. In the earlier example of decontaminating single use N95 face masks, once the single use N95 face mask shortage was resolved, the FDA revoked the face mask EUA, meaning healthcare facilities could no longer decontaminate them.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the CDC, is a federal agency that works to promote health and quality of life *by* preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability and *by* responding to health emergencies.

CDC personnel developed the first practical recommendations for isolation techniques and guidelines for infection control. Although CDC guidelines are not considered regulatory, other agencies rely heavily on them and review healthcare facilities for compliance. Many CDC guidelines are incorporated into the national standards.

In 2008, the CDC released its document Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities. This document is widely used *by* other agencies and healthcare facilities, including SPDs.

U.S. Department of Transportation

The U.S. Department of Transportation or the DOT, is a federal government agency dedicated to ensuring a fast, safe and efficient transportation system. Laws relating to healthcare include those concerning the transportation of minimally processed instrumentation for repair or reprocessing and the transportation of hazardous and radioactive wastes. The DOT inspects and cites organizations for statute violations.

When soiled instrumentation is transported between healthcare and repair facilities, DOT regulations for labeling and packaging must be followed. These requirements include proper biohazard labeling and containment. SPOs should contact their state's DOT for specific requirements.

Note: State or local regulations may be more restrictive than federal regulations. In all cases, regulations with the most stringent provisions apply.

**U.S. Environmental Protection Agency**

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency or the EPA, is the regulatory agency responsible for minimizing greenhouse gases and toxic emissions, regulating the reuse of solid wastes, controlling indoor air pollution, and developing and enforcing chemical regulations.

Every disinfectant and sanitizer manufacturer must obtain an EPA registration number for every covered product. The manufacturer must submit data relating to labeling claims, efficacy and safety. If the data is approved and accepted, a registration number is issued.

**All EPA-approved products must contain the following label information:**

-   Product ingredients
-   Directions for use
-   Product precautions and warnings
-   Directions for storage and disposal
-   EPA registration number
-   Expiration date (if applicable)

SP technicians must always read and consistently follow the information provided on all chemical labels.

The EPA regulates emission standards for ethylene oxide sterilization. Several states have developed standards for the allowable amount of EO a facility may emit into the atmosphere. To date, there are no national emission standards for EO sterilization within the healthcare industry.

Since the EPA regulates disinfectants, all disinfectants used in the SPD and other instrument reprocessing areas must be EPA­ approved.

Occupational Safety and Health Administration

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's primary role and responsibility is to protect workers from occupationally caused illnesses and injuries. Many of OSHA's regulations and standards are represented in laws passed by U.S. Congress. SP technicians should be aware of OSHA regulations pertaining to their work areas.

The Occupational Exposure to Blood borne Pathogens Standard

This comprehensive OSHA guideline outlines employee safety in all areas of the facility as they relate to potential exposure from bloodborne pathogens.

Note: Non-compliance with this standard, not following the guidelines for transportation of continued instruments or not complying with the personal protective equipment, PPE requirements, carries heavy fines.

General Duty Clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act

This act requires that each employer provide each employee with a place of employment that is free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.

OSHA may intervene in a matter of worker protection, even if there is no specific regulation that covers the situation. OSHA personnel conduct announced and unannounced facility inspections. The need for inspections is based on complaints through OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program, the rate of workplace accidents, high-hazard targets, referrals, and follow­ ups from previous visits.

Some OSHA penalties are as follows:

An employer who, willfully or repeatedly violates the requirements of section five of this Act or rules promulgated under section six of this Act, may be assessed a penalty of not more than \$70,000 for each violation, but not less than \$5,000 for each willful violation.

An employer who received a citation for a serious violation under section five of this Act or rules promulgated under section five shall be assessed a penalty up to S7,000 for each such violation.

An employer who received a citation for violating section five or six and is not one of a serious nature may be assessed a penalty up to S7,000 for each violation.

A repeat violation refers to a violation of any standard, regulation or rule where, upon reinspection, a substantially similar violation is found. Failure to abate refers to the failure to correct a prior violation, which may result in high financial penalties.

**OSHA** representatives may enter a facility for a specific reason; however, once inside the facility, they have the right and obligation to investigate any violation they may find in any department. Recent penalties and citations may be viewed by accessing the OSHA website and listing search criteria, such as zip code, facility size or citation type.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, is responsible for the operation of **Medicare, Medicaid** and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. CMS is also one of the agencies that administers the standards of the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.** HIPAA is the act that established national standards to protect patients' medical records and other personal health information. Violating HIPAA rules may result in loss of employment and associated fines to the healthcare facility.

-   **Medicare: is** A federal medical insurance program that primarily serves those older than 65 years (regardless of income), people under 65 with certain disabilities, and people of all ages with end-stage renal disease.
-   **Medicaid: is** A federal and state assistance program that pays covered medical expenses for low-income individuals. It is run by state and local governments within federal guidelines.
-   **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act: P**rovides federal protections for individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information.

CMS is important to SP technicians because the agency performs both announced and unannounced surveys of hospitals, long term care facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, and laboratories. Failure to follow CMS standards may result in the loss of all federal funding to a facility, including Medicare and Medicaid payments.

In 2008, CMS stopped reimbursing hospitals for patients that acquired any of the specific infections or events while in the hospital. These infections or events may include:

-   Foreign object retained after surgery
-   Surgical site infection

Non-payment for the amount of time the patient is in the hospital due to a healthcare associated infection HAIs, means fewer operating funds for the facility.

State Regulatory Agencies

State agencies may also be involved in the regulation of healthcare facilities and the SPDs within them.

-   **Department of Health Services or DHS:**

    Establish local health safety standards that may mirror federal standards or be more stringent. A few states include DHS surveyors in the survey process. DHS surveys are often random and unannounced.

-   **DOT:** is the Department responsible for creating regulations for transporting healthcare waste from the facility to landfills or other final disposal sites.
-   **EPA:** is the Department responsible for creating regulations for biohazardous waste and drain discharge. This is important to SP technicians because the EPA offices monitor chemicals poured into the main sewer lines, and there may be regulations against pouring blood and disinfectants into drains in SP decontamination areas.
-   **OSHA:** Approximately 25 states and two territories have state OSHA offices. These offices typically follow the same penalty criteria as those at the federal level.

Standards and regulations of state agencies may be more restrictive than, but cannot be less restrictive than, those of their federal counterparts. SP technicians must be aware of and consistently comply with state and other localized standards and regulations.

PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS

Professional associations may develop and promote voluntary standards that provide a foundation for processes and practices performed in SP. Some surveying agencies incorporate these standards into their survey requirements.

Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation

The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation known as AAMI, is a nonprofit voluntary consensus organization whose membership is comprised of healthcare technology professionals. AAMI committees and workgroups research and develop new **standards** and **technical information reports or TIRs.**

-   **AAMI Standards: are** Voluntary guidelines representing a consensus of AAMI members that are intended for use by healthcare facilities and manufacturers to help ensure that medical instrumentation is safe for patient use.
-   **Technical Information Reports or TIRs: are** Reports developed by experts in the field that contain valuable information needed by the healthcare industry.

AAMI publishes many standards and TIRs, many of which address functions that affect the SPD, including cleaning, sterilization, packaging, and equipment testing.

ANSI/AAMI ST79:2017 with 2020 Amendments Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in health care facilities is one of the most widely used documents in SP. Although the title states the document is related to steam sterilization, many sections address processes that affect all types of sterilization, such as cleaning, packaging, indicators, product verification, education, and departmental workflow and design.

This document became more important to SPDs when surveyors began referencing ST79 during facility surveys. This document is periodically reviewed, so it is important that the facility has and references the most current version.

Although AAMI is a voluntary organization, AAMI standards are considered a key resource for healthcare guidelines, as many of their documents have been approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Noncompliance with these standards is cited by regulatory and voluntary organizations that inspect healthcare facilities. SP technicians should be familiar with current AAMI standards that address processing and sterilization practices.

Examples of AAMI Standards and TlRs That Affect Sterile Processing

-   **AAMI ST58:** covers Chemical sterilization and high­ level disinfection in health care facilities
-   **AAMI ST79:** is Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in health care facilities
-   **AAMI ST90:** covers Processing of health care products and Quality management systems for processing
-   **AAMI ST97:** covers Flexible and semi-rigid endoscope processing
-   **AAMI TlR34:** covers Water for the reprocessing of medical devices
-   **AAMI TIR63:** covers Management of loaned critical and semi-critical medical devices that require sterilization or high-level disinfection
-   **AAMI TIR67:** Promotes safe practices pertaining to the use of sterilant and disinfectant chemicals in health care facilities
-   **AAMI TIR68:** covers Low and Intermediate Level Disinfection for Medical Devices and Patient Care Equipment and Sterile Processing Environmental Surfaces

American National Standards Institute

ANSI's primary mission is to "enhance the global competitiveness of U.S. business and American quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus standards.

Association of periOperative Registered Nurses

**The Association of periOperative Registered Nurses:** is a professional organization consisting of perioperative nurses and others who are dedicated to providing optimal care to the surgical patient. AORN's committees are comprised of AORN members and allied association members who develop nationally recognized guidelines.

AORN's Guidelines for Perioperative Practice currently have several sections devoted to topics directly affecting the SPD, including cleaning, disinfection, packaging, endoscope processing, and sterilization. AORN is not a regulatory agency; however, regulatory officials look for compliance with AORN guidelines, and surveying agencies also refer to them when reviewing SP areas. Therefore, SP technicians should be aware of AORN recommended practices and guidelines.

Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology

The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, is a voluntary organization whose members work to prevent HAis. APIC members work in conjunction with other agencies, such as the CDC, to adopt standards for infection and disease prevention. SP technicians may interact with their facility's infection preventionist when they conduct departmental surveys to ensure compliance with standards, practices and guidelines.

Infection preventionists may also be in the SPD to collect data relating not only to HAis, but also employee health issues, or to provide Inservice education. The Joint Commission or TJC, for example, holds the Infection Prevention and Control department, in conjunction with SP management, responsible for cleaning and sterilization outcomes within the SPD.

**International Organization for Standardization: or the I**SO, is a non-governmental, international organization that brings together experts to develop voluntary, consensus-based standards. International standards give state of the art specifications for products, services and good practice, helping to make the industry more efficient.

Accreditation Organizations

Healthcare facilities undergo accreditation surveys to demonstrate the level of quality in that facility. Accreditation demonstrates that the healthcare facility follows the current healthcare regulations and standards. Insurance companies and other third parties take that into account when determining whether to reimburse healthcare insurance claims because accreditation may be a condition of reimbursement.

Accreditation is in the best interest of any healthcare facility. Some of the accrediting agencies that perform on-site surveys include:

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities, focuses on the quality of healthcare in outpatient facilities.

The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, is an American organization that accredits its ambulatory healthcare facilities; the TJC, which develops standards and surveys healthcare facilities.

The Accreditation Commission for Health Care surveyors use an educational approach to help facilities enhance the quality of services provided and improve operational efficiencies. Is an Independent foundation dedicated to safeguarding life, property and the environment by providing, acute care, critical access hospitals and Comprehensive Primary Stroke Center Certification.

The Joint Commission

Known as TJC, is a private, independent, nonprofit organization that develops standards for healthcare facilities. TJC personnel evaluate healthcare organizations and programs in the U.S. by conducting onsite surveys at least every three years.

TJC teams arrive unannounced at a facility and spend two to five days studying virtually every aspect of care within the facility. TJC-accredited healthcare facilities are recognized as those that are dedicated to quality practices.

TJC standards are voluntary but nonetheless carry significant weight. Failure to comply with these standards as evaluated through the TJC survey process may result in loss of accreditation by federal and state governments. This, in turn, may result in the forfeiture of millions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid program payments.

National Fire Protection Association

Known as NFPA, is an international organization that works to reduce the burden of fire and other hazards around the world. NFPA develops codes and standards that influence building safety. NFPA is important to SP technicians because of the fire safety standards used for the buildings in which they work. NFPA standards address the fire burden of all disposable packaged items.

United States Pharmacopoeia­ National Formulary

**The United States Pharmacopoeia National Formulary:** creates and revises standards for the purity of medicines, drug substances and dietary supplements. The USP is important to SP technicians who work with purified water or sterilizing water for irrigation.

World Health Organization

**The World Health Organization or the WHO:** is an agency that works to further international cooperation in improving health conditions. Its major task is to combat disease, especially key infectious diseases, and to promote the general health of people worldwide.

Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates

**The Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates or SGNA:** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the safe and effective practice of gastroenterology and endoscopy nursing.

SGNA collects information and establishes standards and guidelines related to the processing of flexible endoscopes.

American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air­ Conditioning Engineers, is responsible for ANSI ASHREA and ASHE Standard 170, the Ventilation of Health Care Facilities. This standard identifies the operating parameters for healthcare heating, ventilation and air conditioning or HVAC systems.

Standards in Other Countries

Other countries have their own standard organizations for healthcare medical device processing. For example, the Canadian Standards Association or CSA is a nonprofit organization that develops standards for industry, government and healthcare for all Canadian provinces. Standards in other countries may not be the same as those in the U.S.

CONCLUSION

Standards and regulations are designed to keep both patients and employees safe. SP technicians should become familiar with the agencies and organizations that develop the requirements that impact their jobs and they should strive to keep abreast of changes as they happen, while ensuring all SP technicians have ready access to the most current versions. Doing so will help create an environment of safety and competency.
