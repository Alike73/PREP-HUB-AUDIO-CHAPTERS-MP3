#### INTRODUCTION

The Sterile Processing (SP) technician plays a significant role in the prevention of **surgical site infections or (SSI)** and healthcare associated infections or (HAI’s). When the importance of this role is understood, technicians recognize that their work practices can mean the difference between a patient's successful surgery or hospital stay and a negative outcome that could lead to infection or possibly death.

#### STERILE PROCESSING PROCESSES

Every step or process in the Sterile Processing department or the (SPD) is carefully designed to prevent poor patient outcomes. Poor outcomes can be traced to many factors, including the condition of instruments, trays and other medical devices processed.

**SP technicians support infection prevention by:**

-   Cleaning contaminated medical devices to make them safe for handling and prepare them for a **biocidal** process
-   Inspecting instruments to help ensure they are safe and functional
-   Assembling and packaging instruments in a manner that facilitates the chosen sterilization method, and providing a barrier after sterilization
-   Selecting and properly using the sterilization or high-level disinfection or (HLD) method for each medical device
-   Safely storing items until they are needed and delivering them using methods that protect the integrity of the sterile packages and items that have undergone disinfection
-   Understanding how to apply infection prevention principles in sterile processing or preventing cross-contamination and recognizing hand hygiene moments
-   **Surgical site infection (SSI): is** An infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place.
-   **Biocidal: is the** Process or the ability to kill or control the growth of living organisms.
-   **Chain of infection: is** The six-step process of an infection spreading from one host to the next.

    While those tasks may appear easy, there are several steps to each process. Each requires attention to detail, understanding of specific protocols and process parameters, an understanding of each medical device's manufacturer's Instructions for use (IFU) and dedication to processing each item exactly as stated. Every medical device not processed according to the manufacturer's IFU has the potential to cause infection in both the patient and healthcare worker.

Cause for Concern

In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the (CDC) reported that approximately one of every thirty-one hospitalized patients, or 687,000, contracted an HAI. Of those 687,000 patients, about 72,000 patients died as a result of their hospitalizations.

Many of these infections may have been preventable. An SSI or Surgical Site Infection, is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place.

The CDC reported that approximately 310 million major surgeries are performed around the world each year, with 40 to 50 million of those procedures performed in the U.S.

Each surgery involves the use of medical devices or instruments that have contact with a patient's sterile tissues or mucous membranes. Infection is a major risk in all of these procedures. Additionally, a growing number of microorganisms are becoming resistant to antibiotics or are naturally difficult to control.

Many of these microorganisms may be easily transferred to other surfaces and people. Controlling these microorganisms and preventing their transmission is the number one responsibility of SP professionals.

From 2014 to the present, endoscope reprocessing has garnered significant media attention because improper processing of endoscopes has led to infection and, in some cases, death.

A January 2014 article published in The Seattle Times noted that more than 100 patients who had undergone colonoscopies at a Washington hospital between 2011 and 2013 were advised to be tested for HIV and hepatitis B and C, after the hospital discovered equipment used in the procedures had not been properly cleaned.

In 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that two endoscopy patients died and five more were infected by CRE also known as the superbug, after being exposed to contaminated endoscopes. 179 more patients who underwent procedures between October 3, 2014, and January 2015 were also advised to be tested.

In May 2016, nine newly reported cases involving the endoscopic retrograde endoscope, were linked to nine patient infections, resulting in three deaths at a hospital in Colorado.

These incidents led to research into endoscope reprocessing.

Infection prevention principles and practices are based on knowledge of the nature and characteristics of disease-producing microorganisms; this includes an understanding about how they are transmitted in the healthcare environment and their place in the **chain of infection.**

The way an item is used also plays a significant role in how it is processed. The more SP technicians know about microorganisms, the better equipped they are to prevent the spread of these organisms.

##### Protection from Pathogens

In the early 1970s, the CDC established the first practical recommendations for the isolation technique. The new recommendations categorized infections and communicable diseases based upon the likely mode of transmission. To protect healthcare staff and patients from infectious diseases, standard precautions were adopted; the basis of this is to treat all human blood, bodily fluids and other potentially infectious materials as infectious.

Standard precautions drive the infection prevention and control procedures that SP technicians must use because they are exposed to contaminated instrumentation and equipment. Failure to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) increases the individual's risk of acquiring an infection.

The primary purpose of the SPD is to stop the spread of disease­ producing microorganisms to patients from instruments and other medical devices. SP technicians must ensure that items used in patient care, including instruments, utensils, supplies and equipment, are made safe by either cleaning, disinfection or sterilization. This chapter addresses how SP technicians control the spread of microorganisms and prevent infection. Understanding **asepsis** in healthcare is an important piece of the basic knowledge required to work in the SPD.

#### 

#### PRINCIPLES OF ASEPSIS

Asepsis can be defined as the absence of microorganisms that cause disease. **Aseptic technique** includes any activity or procedure that prevents infection or breaks the chain of infection.

**There are two types of aseptic technique:**

-   **Medical asepsis: or the** clean technique, are Procedures performed to reduce the number of microorganisms in order to minimize their spread. Examples include handwashing and equipment decontamination.
-   **Surgical asepsis:** or the sterile technique, are Procedures performed to eliminate the presence of all microorganisms and or introduction of microorganisms to an area, proper processing, storage and techniques performed in the Operating Room to prevent contamination of sterile instruments and supplies.
-   **Asepsis:** is The absence of microorganisms that cause disease.
-   **Aseptic technique: is** Any activity or procedure that prevents infection or breaks the chain of infection.
-   **Asepsis medical:** are Clean techniques or procedures performed to reduce the number of microorganisms and minimize their spread.
-   **Asepsis surgical:** are Surgical technique or procedures performed to eliminate the presence of all microorganisms and/or prevent the introduction of microorganisms to an area.

**There are five basic principles of asepsis:**

-   **Principle one:** Know what is dirty. Items that have been used for patient care are considered contaminated. An item is either contaminated or not contaminated. For the SP technician, the terms "dirty" and "contaminated" mean the same thing. Microbial contamination cannot be seen with the naked eye; however, it can be present, even when it is not seen. Examples of contaminated items include opened surgical instrument trays, IV pumps, and suction machines that have been sitting in a patient room.
-   **Principle two:** Know what is clean. Cleanliness is the basis of aseptic technique. Mechanical cleaning removes soil and most microorganisms. Any item that has been properly cleaned via manual or mechanical means is considered clean. If that item has been cleaned with a detergent disinfectant or a thermal decontamination process, it is considered clean and decontaminated, the physical task of washing/cleaning removes soil and most microorganisms.
-   **Principle three:** Know what is sterile. Sterility is defined as the absence of all microbes. Sterility is impossible to see with the naked eye; one cannot look at a specific item and determine its sterility.
-   **Principle four:** Keep dirty, clean and sterile areas separate. ll1ere must be separation between the three areas to allow a margin of safety. Clean or decontaminated items must not come in contact with dirty items. If they do, they must again be considered dirty. If sterile items come in contact with non­ sterile items, they must also be considered non-sterile.
-   Principle five: Remedy contamination immediately. When dirty, clean and sterile areas or items have not been separated, the situation must be corrected immediately. One who observes a procedure has as much responsibility for maintaining proper aseptic technique as the person who performs the procedure. There are times when only an SP technician will know or suspect that something may be contaminated. Even though processing the item may result in more work, this must be done to protect the patient.

    A careless attitude may lead to an increased risk of infection, so SP technicians must always be aware of their actions. By adhering to the principles of asepsis, the risk of infection will be reduced for patients and the facility's employees. The responsibility of SP technicians to provide safe items for use should never be underestimated or compromised.

    **SP technicians must assume several important responsibilities in their facility's infection prevention and control efforts. The SPD's infection prevention and control goals are to:**

-   Eliminate or destroy all potentially infectious contaminants present on reusable instruments and equipment.
-   Safely distribute reusable and single-use items required for the delivery of patient care.
-   Establish and enforce standards for decontamination, disinfection and sterilization in various healthcare settings.

The importance of these responsibilities is clear. The use of medical devices that have not been properly handled, disinfected or sterilized, can cause infections in patients and staff. SP technicians are responsible for providing safe items that support good patient outcomes.

PERSONAL HYGIENE AND ATTIRE

Preventing the spread of microorganisms and maintaining appropriate environments for clean and sterile items requires good self-management skills. Hygiene and adherence to dress code protocols are critical components of infection prevention in the SPD.

**Personal Hygiene**

**Hand hygiene:** is a term that means either handwashing or using an approved antiseptic hand rub such as an alcohol-based product. Hand hygiene is considered the single most important factor in reducing infections. Handwashing refers to the use of soap, water and friction to wash one's hands.

**Hand hygiene: is** The act of washing one's hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub.

1.  Remove all jewelry
2.  Turn on faucet using a paper towel
3.  Wet hands and apply soap all over your hands, front and back, including forearms half way to your elbows
4.  Work soap into a lather and scrub hands for at least 20 seconds
5.  Keep hands at a lower angle than elbows to prevent dirt from ridding back up
6.  Dry hands with clean disposable towels
7.  Turn off the faucet using a clean disposable towel

SPDs should be equipped with handwashing sinks conveniently located for easy access. SP technicians should wash their hands only in dedicated handwashing sinks (not in sinks used for decontamination purposes).

Because fingernails harbor microorganisms, they should be kept clean and not extend beyond the fingertips. Long nails increase the risk of tearing gloves. Fingernail polish should not be worn in the SPD because nail polish may chip and fall onto an instrument set. Artificial nails should not be worn in the SPD because they also harbor microorganisms and may detach and fall into a tray, unnoticed.

Infection prevention begins at home. Personal hygiene is important for the prevention of infections. Bathing and shampooing regularly, wearing clean clothing and practicing good hand hygiene prepares SP technicians to continue this practice in the healthcare facility.

Personnel with open or weeping wounds or excessive skin irritations should refrain from handling any patient care equipment until the condition is resolved or medically evaluated.

##### 

##### Hand Hygiene

**Hand hygiene** should be performed prior to starting work, upon entering or leaving the work areas, before and after eating, using the restroom or whenever hands become soiled or contaminated. Hand hygiene should also be done before handling instruments and medical devices for sterilization packaging, contaminants, oils, and soils can be transferred to instruments from the hands of personnel compromising the sterilization process.

**Infection Prevention and Control** experts recommend that hands be washed immediately and thoroughly if they become soiled with blood, bodily fluids, secretions or excretions. After contact with contaminated items without visible soil or after gloves are removed, an alcohol-based hand rub should be used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Approved non-oil-based hand lotions may be used after handwashing to keep the skin healthy and to minimize skin irritation and excessive drying.

##### 

##### Attire

Most of the SP area is considered semi-restricted, and SP technicians must wear clean scrub attire provided by and laundered through the healthcare facility. The Association of periOperative Registered Nurses or (AORN) states that home laundering is not monitored for quality, consistency or safety. Home washing machines may not have the adjustable parameters or controls required to achieve the necessary thermal measures such as water temperature; mechanical measures; or chemical measures such as capacity for additives to neutralize the alkalinity of the water, soap or detergent to reduce the microbial levels in soiled scrub attire. Healthcare facility laundering protects the employee and other staff members, patients, family members, and the public.

Attire should be clean and not worn outside the facility. Technicians should change out of their street clothing and shoes (those worn at home) and into scrubs and shoes kept at the facility. Usually, there will be a locker space for personal belongings. At the end of the workday, scrubs must be left behind in the facility's laundry, protecting employees from infecting anyone at home or in the community. Jewelry, including necklaces, watches and rings, should not be worn in the department because it can harbor microorganisms, and some jewelry items may accidentally fall into instrument sets.

Lanyards, if used, should be left at the facility and cleaned on a regular basis. Personal electronics, including phones, should be stored and kept out of SP areas. Personal devices can harbor microorganisms and should be cleaned regularly.

Other personal items, such as fuzzy pens, stuffed animals, and artificial plants should be left at home. Backpacks and purses should also not be brought into the work area, these items are difficult to clean and, like cellular devices, harbor microorganisms.

Basic attire should be worn in every area of the SPD and by everyone working in or visiting the department, this includes anyone entering to clean or perform repairs.

Scrub attire should always be donned or put on just prior to starting work. And doffed or removed before leaving work.

A disposable bouffant-type head covering should be worn in all areas of the department. Head covers should cover all head hair, except eyelashes and eyebrows. Reusable head covers are not allowed in the facility, should be covered with a bouffant cover to prevent contaminating the area with outside bacteria or with bacteria that may have multiplied on the caps clue to improper cleaning. Skull-type caps are no longer suggested for use because they do not always fully cover head hair.

Beards and mustaches should be covered with an approved beard cover to prevent facial hair from shedding onto the items being processed.

Sturdy, closed-toe shoes with non-skid soles should be worn in the department. Shoes should be able to protect the feet from items that may inadvertently fall from work areas. It is good practice to have shoes dedicated to the area and not worn out of the facility.

A cover gown or lab coat may be used to protect the scrub attire when leaving the department for another area of the same facility.

**Note**: Cover gown or lab coat are not meant to protect departmental attire while outside of the building.

-   Scrub attire should be changed daily, anytime it becomes soiled, or as soon as it may have become contaminated. Scrub attire should at least consist of clean pants and a top. Some facilities provide long-sleeved jackets.
-   T-shirts, if worn, should be completely covered by the scrub top. No part of the T-shirt should be visible outside the scrub attire.
-   Some facilities allow outside v1s1tors to wear disposable cover clothing, such as jumpsuits, instead of scrub attire. The disposable cover attire should also cover all outside clothing.

    **Decontamination attire:** The decontamination area is a restricted area, and all individuals working in this area must comply with PPE/dress code requirements. This is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and was established to help ensure workers are protected from potential pathogens. Decontamination PPE is required for anyone who enters the area, even if only for a very brief period.

    The risk of exposure to pathogenic microorganisms can be reduced by diligently following dress codes in decontamination areas. For example, fluid-resistant gowns provide protection from splashes that may soak into and contaminate regular scrub attire.

    All of the basic attire outlined previously, except the cover gown, should be worn in the decontamination area. Because of the nature of the work in the decontamination area which include soiled and contaminated devices, water and chemicals, additional attire is required. This Additional Attire is called Personal protective Equipment or PPE

    Examples of PPE worn in the decontamination area.

    **Decontamination PPE includes:**

-   Gloves approved for the decontamination area. To better protect the hands, these gloves are thicker than examination gloves. They also have longer cuffs with some being elbow length, so they can be placed over the gown cuff to keep fluids from flowing into the glove or up the gown sleeve.
-   Fluid-resistant mask that fits around the ears or tied behind the head are used to protect the nose and mouth.
-   Level 3 fluid-resistant gown or jumpsuit to protect scrub clothes and skin. Fluid-resistant materials will keep fluids away from the skin, while standard fabrics will absorb fluids, allowing the skin beneath the fabric to become wet and contaminated.
-   Goggles are approved to protect the eyes.
-   Full face shields and hoods that protect the face, mouth, nose and other exposed areas such as the neck. Note: Wearing a face shield does not replace the need to also wear a face mask.
-   Shoe covers protect the shoes from contamination. Shoe covers should be worn even if the shoes are dedicated to department use only. Using boot-length covers is not required but will help protect the leg area as well.

    Recap of basic PPE requirements and the reason each component is important. Remember There is a proper way to don and doff PPE.

    **When wearing PPE, SP technicians should use safe work practices to protect themselves and limit the spread of contamination by:**

-   Keeping hands away from the face
-   Changing gloves when torn or heavily contaminated
-   Consistently performing hand hygiene before and after wearing PPE

| CDC recommendations for donning (putting on) PPE | CDC recommendations for doffing (removing) PPE          |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **l.** Gown or jumpsuit                          | **l.** Remove shoe covers                               |

#### MANAGING THE ENVIRONMENT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF BACTERIA

The first step in maintaining environmental integrity is to control the traffic that enters and passes through the SPD. As previously addressed, most areas of the SPD are considered semi-restricted and the dress codes apply to all who enter. Departmental dress standards for visitors such as sales representatives, maintenance personnel and clinical engineering staff vary between facilities. In some facilities, they must change into surgical scrubs, in others, coveralls or jumpsuits worn over their street clothes. SP technicians must protect the integrity of the environment by enforcing traffic control guidelines. This may sometimes mean educating visitors about dress code and traffic control protocols.

Dress code requirements may change as SP technicians move from one area to another. For example, surgical scrubs and hair coverings may be appropriate for the clean assembly area whereas OSHA-required PPE is necessary for the decontamination area.

Dress codes are an important part of traffic control; therefore, SP technicians must understand which attire is appropriate in different areas.

**Note**: If in an unfamiliar area and unsure of the attire requirements, ask before entering.

**Areas that SP technicians routinely travel through may have three separate traffic control/dress code requirements:**

-   **Restricted Areas:** are areas where sterile surgical procedures are performed, and the decontamination area of the SPD. Surgical scrub attire, hair coverings and masks are required in this restricted areas. Workers within the sterile field, including surgeons, surgical technologists and nurses are also required to wear a sterile surgical gown and gloves.
-   **Semi-restricted Areas:** are The areas which include peripheral support areas to the OR, SP clean assembly and sterile storage areas. Surgical scrub attire and hair coverings are required in these areas.
-   **Unrestricted Areas:** These areas include normal traffic areas such as hospital corridors, most offices, locker rooms and general public areas (e.g., cafeteria and waiting rooms). Street clothes may be worn in unrestricted areas.

SPDs use signage to assist in traffic control. All restricted and semi-restricted areas also have signage that informs people entering the area about the need for specific dress codes.

OSHA'S BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS STANDARD

OSHA is the primary federal agency charged with the enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation. The response to concerns, OSHA published the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to recognize the potential for occupational exposure lo bloodborne diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV. It places the responsibility for providing a safe work environment on the employer.

The standard requires a written exposure control plan the ECP be created to summarizes the employer's program for the protection of workers from occupational exposure to bloodborne diseases.

**This plan includes:**

-   Implementation of various methods of exposure control, including following Standard Precautions such as the proper use of PPE, and the use of engineering controls to physically remove hazards, and the development of work practice controls
-   Policies and procedures to prevent occupational exposure and transmission of bloodborne pathogens
-   Housekeeping protocols: a Provision of a clean and sanitary working environment, including regularly scheduled cleaning using hospital germicides or disinfectants be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA
-   Hepatitis B vaccination
-   Recordkeeping: Including Proof of training upon initial hire and annually thereafter. If significant changes are made to the ECP, additional training is required to address the changes. Medical records regarding any exposure must be maintained.
-   The use of fluorescent orange or orange-red biohazard labels to identify contaminated items
-   Disposal of all sharp items in rigid, puncture-proof containers that are covered and properly labeled or color­ coded
-   Transport of reusable sharps in enclosed carts or hard-sided containers to prevent injury

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS IN STERILE PROCESSING AREAS

In addition to specific guidelines for dress codes and standard precautions, there are environmental tools designed to help SP technicians promote infection prevention. Some tools are evident; others, while not as evident, still play an important role in maintaining an environment that is safe for patients and employees.

##### 

##### Physical Design

An SPD's physical design should incorporate a clear separation of clean and dirty, and workflow patterns should be designed that create a one-way flow of goods from dirty to clean

In addition to walls separating the decontamination area from the rest of the department, the area should be designed to reduce the likelihood that airborne bacteria can be transmitted from the decontamination area to the clean area. This is accomplished with the use of positive and negative air pressure. The decontamination area has negative or lower air pressure. This means that when a door or window is opened between the separate work areas, air flows from the clean or positive air pressure area to the dirty or negative air pressure area. This minimizes the risk of airborne bacteria in the decontamination area being carried to the clean area.

The airflow created using positive and negative air pressure. To maintain the balance necessary for air pressure systems to function correctly, windows and doors between the decontamination and clean areas must remain closed when not in use.

In addition to the air pressure requirements, SP areas must meet specific temperature, humidity and air exchange requirements. These vary by work area, and SP technicians must be familiar with the requirements for each specific area and ensure that policies designed to manage airflow, temperature and humidity are followed at all times. SP temperature and humidity are controlled by the facility heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. The parameters for SP areas can be established by identifying them based on when the HVAC system was initially installed or last upgraded.

**Note**: Some facilities may choose to use 20% for the lower humidity level. SPDs should check with their supply and equipment manufacturers to ensure that the lower humidity is acceptable for items stored in the area.

In many departments, SP technicians may be responsible for collecting data, such as temperatures and humidity and recording that data, as part of their department's formal documentation system.

Use of freestanding fans should not be permitted in any SP work area. Fans create highly turbulent air flow, which recirculates dust and microorganisms from the floor and work surfaces and interferes with airflow.

##### 

##### Work Area Cleanliness

The cleaner the work area, the more likely that the products prepared in SP areas will be safe for use in a sterile environment.

Dust and lint particles do not only carry bacteria. In some cases, lint remaining in a sterile set may enter the patient's body during surgery and cause infection. SP technicians must minimize the amount of contaminants, such as dust, lint and bacteria, in all work areas.

Bacteria can be transmitted by contact with contaminated items. Inanimate objects that can transmit bacteria are called **fomites.** Common fomites that become contaminated in SP areas include door handles, computer pads, keyboards, telephones, work surfaces, and other items routinely handled by multiple people. SP technicians should know that by routinely cleaning these items and their general work areas (workstations), they can control the unwanted spread of bacteria within their workplace.

-   **Fomite: is** An inanimate object that could house and or transmit bacteria, an example would be a doorknob, or a buttons in an elevator

Food and beverages should not be allowed in SP work areas. This standard is well understood for decontamination areas; however, this rule is also necessary in clean areas of the department for the following reasons:

-   Beverages should not be allowed because they may spill and contaminate sterile items, or they may spill onto items that need to be sterilized and impact sterilization outcomes. Spilling may also contaminate items being assembled for sterilization or damage count sheets, reference books and other items on the workstation.
-   Food should not be allowed because it may also contaminate items. SP technicians should not eat in their work areas because their hands may become soiled and they could transmit bacteria. Snack foods can leave an oily residue on hands that can adhere to instruments being packaged for sterilization. This oil may impede the contact of the sterilant with the entire surface of the instrument. Food and beverages also attract insects and other pests and may increase the chance of such creatures invading the work area.

##### 

##### OSHA regulations prohibit the consumption of food and drink in areas in which work involving exposure or potential exposure to blood or potentially infectious material exist or where the potential of contaminated work surfaces exists as it does in SP areas.

##### 

##### Environmental cleaning (housekeeping), often referred to as Environmental Services (EVS), is a vital component in the SPD's overall infection prevention and control process. Procedures used in SP cleaning should be the same as those used in the OR and delivery rooms. Environmental cleaning should be based on an assessment of risk in each SP area. A team consisting of EVS and SP personnel should define the type of cleaning requirements for each area, including the surfaces to be cleaned (with responsibility assigned), and discuss the cleaning and disinfectant chemicals to be used and the frequency of cleaning. EVS and SP staff should follow these specific cleaning guidelines:

-   **Floors**: should be wet mop cleaned and disinfected at least daily, and should never be swept or dusted, because dust will rise and fall on items such as instruments.
-   The decontamination area should have separate and dedicated cleaning equipment such as mops and buckets. Items used to clean the decontamination area should not be used elsewhere.
-   **Horizontal work surfaces,** such as counters and worktables, should be cleaned at least daily and, preferably, every shift.
-   **Light fixtures or their covers and air vents** should be cleaned at least every six months or as necessary.

    This function is usually performed by another department such as EVS or Facilities Maintenance.

-   **Other surfaces** which include walls, cabinets and racks, should be cleaned on a regularly scheduled basis.
-   **Trash,** should be emptied as needed, on schedule and at least daily when areas are in use.

    Although many SP housekeeping functions are performed by EVS personnel, routine cleaning of sterile storage cabinets, carts and racks is usually the responsibility of SP technicians who have been trained to properly handle sterile items and who know specific product names and locations.

    A cleaning schedule and checklist should be established for each area, and cleaning verification tools should be utilized as part of an audit system to measure the adequacy of cleaning performed.

##### 

##### Other Environmental Cleaning Requirements

Fixtures and furnishings in the SPD must be constructed of materials that can be cleaned; such cleaning should be performed on a regularly scheduled basis.

The area designated for sterile storage may consist of either open (rack) or closed (cabinet) storage units. The decision about the type of storage used is based on the types of items to be stored and the amount of traffic in the area. For example, closed cabinets may be used in high-traffic areas, and open shelving (racks) may be used in more controlled, low-traffic areas. Open-rack systems should have a solid bottom, so items stored on the lower shelves are protected from contamination during housekeeping tasks.

Technicians in the SPD work with items at all stages of the decontamination, sterilization, storage and distribution processes, so they must understand the basic infection control principles. To ensure the workflow is maintained and items are handled properly at each stage in the processing cycle, technicians must understand and practice the principles of asepsis.

An Important Concern

Some microorganisms are becoming resistant to antibiotics or are naturally very difficult to control. Many of these resistant microorganisms can be transferred easily to other surfaces and people. Controlling these microorganisms and preventing their transmission is the number one responsibility of the SPD.

Understanding the way microorganisms can be transmitted is the key to helping stop cross­ contamination.

#### ELEMENTS OF TRANSMISSION AND THE CHAIN OF INFECTION

Infection transmission is a complicated process that involves many factors for a pathogenic microorganism to result in disease or illness.

**According to the Centers for Disease Control's Guideline for Isolation Prevention:**

Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings, 2007, the transmission of infectious agents in a healthcare setting requires six elements: a **causative agent, reservoir, portal of exit, mode of transmission, portal of entry** and **susceptible host.** This infectious disease process is better known as the chain of infection.

CHAIN OF INFECTION ELEMENTS

1.  **Causative agent: is A** pathogenic Microorganism that causes an infectious or disease such as HIV or Corona 19
2.  **A Reservoir: is a** Place where an infectious agent a microorganism could survive.
3.  **A Portal of exit: is A** Path by which an infectious agent leaves the reservoir.
4.  **A Mode of transmission: is a** Method of transfer of an infectious agent from the reservoir to a susceptible host.
5.  **A Portal of entry: is** The path used by an infectious agent to enter a susceptible host.
6.  **A Susceptible host: is a** Person or animal that lacks the ability to resist an infection by an infectious agent due to chronic illness or other factors.

Causative Agent

The first link is the causative agent (the pathogenic microorganism): bacteria, virus, fungi, protozoa or prions. The characteristics that make the organism capable of causing disease include:

-   Invasiveness: which is An organism's ability to invade the host and cause damage
-   Pathogenicity: An organism's ability to gain entry into the host to cause disease
-   Virulence: is The Degree of pathogenicity
-   Infectious dose: the Quantity of organisms required to cause the disease
-   Viability: or the Organism's ability to survive outside of the host
-   Antimicrobial resistance: whish is the agents Ability to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, antivirals or other deactivating agents like disinfectants or sterilants

The only way to interrupt the transmission of a causative agent is to eliminate it. This can be done by promptly initiating the appropriate processes, such as using aseptic technique to avoid cross-contamination, physically removing the contaminated substances through cleaning, and using effective disinfection and sterilization processes.

##### 

##### Reservoir/Source

The second link in the chain of infection is the reservoir or source of the agent, a place in which an infectious agent can survive. In the healthcare setting, the most common reservoirs are human sources such as patients, healthcare personnel, family and visitors; however, inanimate objects, including environmental surfaces, surgical instruments and devices, have also been implicated, as have contaminated food, water, or intravenous fluids.

Those with active infections but without obvious symptoms, and those who are **carriers,** represent the greatest risk to other patients and healthcare workers because the presence of disease­ producing organisms may go undetected.

-   **Carrier: is** A person who is infected with an infectious disease but displays no symptoms. Although unaffected by the disease themselves, carriers can transmit the disease to others.

Good personal hygiene and health habits, the use of appropriate housekeeping measures, and proper cleaning and sterilization of hospital equipment can eliminate reservoirs.

##### 

##### Portal of Exit

The third link is the portal of exit or the path by which an infectious agent leaves the reservoir. Portals of exit associated with humans and animal reservoirs include:

-   Respiratory tract, by coughing and or sneezing
-   Genitourinary tract, through urine, vaginal secretions or semen
-   Gastrointestinal tract: through vomit or stool
-   Skin or mucous membrane: through wound drainage
-   Blood, during a blood transfusions or incidental contact with blood

##### Portal of Entry

The fifth link in the chain of infection is the portal of entry or the path used by an infectious agent to enter a susceptible host.

-   Transplacental, through the placenta from mother to baby

Common ways SP technicians can block the portal of exit include covering the nose and mouth when sneezing/coughing, disposing facial tissues immediately after use, performing proper hand hygiene, disposing of trash, and effectively using PPE.

##### Mode of Transmission

The fourth link is the mode of transmission or how a pathogenic organism is spread. This can vary by the type of organism and its route of transmission.

**Direct contact** occurs when microorganisms are transferred directly from one infected person to another via blood or other blood-containing bodily fluids. Indirect contact occurs through a contaminated object or person such as through inadequately cleaned or sterilized instruments, the hands of healthcare personnel, or contaminated PPE. Some infections transmitted by contact, include herpes simplex virus, Staph virus and Clostridium difficile.

**Droplet transmission** occurs when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks during procedures such as endotracheal intubation or suctioning. Infectious droplets can travel short distances to the susceptible person's mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Some of the diseases spread in this manner include influenza virus, COVID-19, group A Streptococcus, adenovirus, and some types of meningitis.

Airborne transmission occurs when very small droplet particles are dispersed in the air over long distances by air currents and are then inhaled by susceptible individuals. Infectious agents transmitted by this route include Tuberculosis and chickenpox.

**Common vehicle:** transmission occurs when infectious agents are present in a vehicle, such as food like salmonella, blood, like HIV or water, like pseudomonas.

**Vector-borne:** transmission rarely occurs in U.S. hospitals. Agents can be carried on insects on their feet, or wings of flies, or through the bites of insect or arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks and fleas.

**Pathogenic**: transmission can be interrupted through proper hand hygiene, cleaning, decontamination, disinfection and sterilization, standard and isolation precautions as well as proper food handling, proper water treatment and maintenance of HVAC systems.

Patients are particularly vulnerable to transmission in areas where the usual defense mechanisms are bypassed. Portals of entry associated with a human host include:

-   Respiratory tract
-   Genitourinary tract
-   Gastrointestinal tract
-   Skin or mucous membranes
-   Transplacental
-   Parenteral
-   **Parenteral:** Something that is put inside the body but not by swallowing, an example being an injection administered into the muscle.

Safe protocols include maintaining clean or sterile techniques during patient care procedures. Proper hand hygiene can alter access of an infectious agent to a susceptible host. Other practices involve using only properly disinfected/sterilized equipment for invasive procedures and safe handling and disposal of sharps.

##### Susceptible Host

Most of the factors that influence whether a person acquires an infection are related to the sixth and final link: whether the individual is a susceptible host and lacks the ability to resist infection. Some who are exposed to an infectious agent will become severely ill and die, while others never develop symptoms at all. Some may progress from **colonization** to symptomatic disease shortly after exposure to the pathogen, while others will become temporarily or chronically colonized and never have symptoms.

-   **Colonization** A process that occurs when microorganisms live on or in a host organism, but do not invade tissues or cause damage.

Whether or not an individual becomes susceptible to a microorganism can be influenced by various factors:

-   Age, the very young or the very old
-   Disease history or underlying diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease
-   Medications and treatments, that can compromise the immune system, including chemotherapy, radiation and steroids
-   Trauma, the injury itself and the treatment of the injury can increase the risk of infection

Some measures to boost the ability to fight disease include treating the primary disease by keeping blood sugar under control in diabetics, administering vaccines such as pneumonia and influenza and recognizing that patients are at high risk for infection.

From an SP perspective, there are many opportunities to interrupt the chain of infection and play an active and important role in preventing and controlling infectious diseases.

Conclusion

SP technicians face the ongoing challenge of ensuring that the instruments and equipment they process are safe for patient use. Advances in technology and the emergence of new microbiological challenges have increased the difficulty in meeting this challenge. Every SP technician must appreciate the importance of infection control and prevention and thoroughly understand their role in the process.
