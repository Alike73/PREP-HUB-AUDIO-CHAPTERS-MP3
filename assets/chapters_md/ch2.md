INTRODUCTION

Sterile Processing (SP) technicians require knowledge of medical terms to help them succeed on the job. Medical terminology is the language of medical professionals that allows healthcare workers to communicate more effectively. This special terminology is used to describe parts of the body, diseases, instruments and surgical procedures.

IMPORTANCE OF MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY

The Healthcare Profession

The Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) specifically states that "skilled and competent allied health care providers and support personnel arc valued members of the perioperative care team, contributing to safe patient care and positive patient outcomes." As such, SP technicians must have a grasp of the medical terminology used by healthcare customers and fellow SP professionals. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), in ANSI/AAMI ST79: 2017 with 2020 amendments, *Comprehensive guide to sterilization and sterility assurance in health care facilities,* specifically states that SP technicians must be "knowledgeable and competent" to adequately perform their vital tasks. The Joint Commission (TJC) states that in order to maintain a reliable system for medical device processing, institutions must place an emphasis upon the "orientation, training and competency of health care workers" who are responsible for this task. Understanding medical terminology is part of the training and competency that SP technicians should possess.

Understanding the Operating Room

SP technicians must provide Operating Room (OR) personnel with the instruments and supplies needed for surgical procedures. As these needs are conveyed, SP technicians must also understand the terminology/language spoken to them in order to provide quality customer service and contribute to positive patient outcomes.

For example, if the OR calls for instrumentation needed for an emergency pericardia window, a knowledgeable SP technician will know that this is a cardiac (heart) procedure that involves cutting into the pericardium (a membranous sac that surrounds the heart) in order to drain fluid from the pericardia! space into the pleural (chest) cavity. Also, if the OR calls for a case cart for a **STAT** repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), this request will be responded to immediately because the SP technician will understand that the patient is at risk of losing their life.

-   **STAT:** Abbreviation for the Latin term *statim,* meaning immediately or at once

Providing Quality Service to the Patient

It is through knowing and understanding medical terminology that SP technicians are able to understand what is being asked of them. This knowledge of medical terminology enables the SP technician to react appropriately when the OR or other medical staff makes a request; however, the opposite is also true. If the OR makes a request that is not understood, the productivity of the OR *may* be compromised. This interruption of the perioperative process can compromise the quality of service rendered to the patient and *may* cause a delay in treatment.

ANATOMY OF A MEDICAL TERM

SP technicians frequently encounter specialized medical terms in their daily work activities and each of those terms contains key elements to help staff better understand the word's origin and meaning. As technicians learn the meanings of these names, they will have a greater understanding of what their work entails.

**Word Elements**

Majority of medical terms are of either Greek or Latin origin. "Pericardium;' for example, is composed of two Greek **word elements:** peri (meaning "around") and cardia (meaning "heart"). The term refers to the membranous sac that surrounds the heart as well as the roots of the great vessels of the heart. The term "rigor mortis" is composed of two Latin word elements: rigor (stiffness) and mortis (meaning "of death"); the term refers to the stiffening of the body that occurs after death. Many terms combine both Greek and Latin word elements to form a single medical term. For example, the term "claustrophobia" (meaning fear of enclosed spaces) joins the Latin word element "claustrum" (enclosed space) to a Greek word element "phobia" (fear).

At first, medical terminology may seem difficult to understand and overwhelming; however, after a working knowledge of these word elements is gained, it becomes easier to analyze and use the words effectively.

Medical terminology changes with the dynamics of evolving technology in healthcare. New terms, abbreviations and words are constantly being created to meet the needs of this new technology. Through word association and memorization of basic medical terms and word elements, SP technicians can establish a solid foundation upon which to build an extensive vocabulary. A SP technician's vocabulary must be in a constant state of growth, evolution and development.

Medical terminology can seem difficult, if not impossible, to learn. Here are a few hints to make studying easier and more effective:

Become comfortable with the word elements before breaking down terms. Understanding the word elements helps students understand the more complex medical terms.

1.  Write down the terms
2.  Record the words and then play them back
3.  Create flashcards and practice with classmates, colleagues, friends or family

**Prefixes, Roots and Suffixes**

The anatomy of a medical word consists of three-word elements:

**Root word element:** tells the primary meaning of a medical term, which can then be modified by either a prefix, suffix or both. Many roots signify a procedure, disease or body part. For example, the term "cardiology;' the medical term for "heart;' features the root "cardio" conjunction with the suffix "ology" referring to the study of the heart. The term "endocarditis" also features the root "cardio" but in this example, the root is modified by a prefix "endo" (meaning "within") as well as a suffix "itis" (meaning "inflammation"). When the entire word is analyzed, the word means "inflammation of the inner portion of the heart:' The term "cardiothoracic" features two roots: "cardio" (meaning "heart") and "thoracic" (meaning "chest"); a cardiothoracic surgeon performs surgery on the heart, its major vessels and the lungs. The term "electrosurgery" also features a combination of two roots. While the root "electro" refers to the use of electrical current, the root "surgery" refers to the act of performing surgery and the use of electrical current to cut and cauterize during surgery.

**Prefix word element:** comes before the root. When added to a root (at the beginning of a word), the prefix can alter or modify its meaning. For example, the medical term for the prefix "around" is "peri"; the term "pericardia!" means "around the heart:' The term "perioperative" refers to the entire process surrounding a surgical procedure: before (preoperative), during (intraoperative) and after (postoperative). The prefix "peri" is also found in the surgical instrument "periosteal elevator;' an instrument used to remove tissue from around a bone (the periosteum). Here, the prefix "peri" (around) is attached to the root "osteo" (bone). Even the term "abnormal" functions in this way. The "ab" functions as a prefix to negate the meaning of the root

**Suffix word element:** comes after the root. When added to the root (at the end of a word), the suffix can also alter or modify its meaning. For example, the medical term for the suffix that means inflammation is "itis"; the term "pericarditis" refers to inflammation (itis) around (peri) the heart (cardio). 1l1e term "tonsillitis" refers to inflammation of the tonsils. Bronchitis refers to inflammation of the bronchi, which are the tubes extending from the trachea into both sides of the lungs. When the suffix "itis" is found at the end of a medical term (modifying a root word preceding it), it means inflammation is present.

A **combining vowel** (typically an "o") is either added to a root or removed from it lo case the pronunciation of the word.

An easy way to remember the difference between prefix (which comes before the root) and suffix (which comes after the root) is to put the words in alphabetical order: prefix, root and suffix. This tells you that prefix is the first word element and suffix is the last word element.

**Note**: Not all medical terms consist of three-word elements. A Medical term will only be formed by a root alone, combining two roots, a root and suffix, or n prefix and root. Some medical terms can even be formed by combining three roots.

-   **Word elements:** Parts of a word.
-   **Root word element:** Tells the primary meaning of a word; also called the base word element
-   **Prefix word element:** The word element that comes before the root word element.
-   **Suffix word element:** The word element that comes after the root word element.
-   **Combining vowel:** A letter, typically an "o" is sometimes used to ease the pronunciation of a medical word.

The best way to learn the meaning of a medical term is to analyze and understand its components so that the word can be taken apart. Begin with the suffix (if present) since it most often gives a clue and meaning about the root and how it is being used. Then consider the root and prefix, if present. In other words, consider the overall relationship between each word element in the term. Medical terms can be a lot like building blocks, if one can figure out how they fit together, one can determine what they mean.

When analyzing medical terms, several suffixes meaning "pertaining to" may be encountered.

Making medical terms conform to the basic rules of spelling and pronunciation may result in letters in the word element being changed, dropped or added. When analyzing a medical term, it is sometimes best to start with the suffix. In this way, one can readily identify if the word relates to a surgical procedure, a medical condition or a portion of the human anatomy.

**Understanding Usage**

Learning medical terminology can be an almost endless process. As new surgical procedures are created, new medical terminology will also be created to refer to these procedures. SP technicians must understand the language spoken to them by the OR and medical staff to provide them with the goods and services needed for their procedures. Language frequently used by the OR utilizes abbreviations or acronyms to refer to various types of surgeries. Figure 2.8 contains a list of some surgical procedure abbreviations or acronym

**ANATOMY OF A SURGICAL PROCEDURE**

Once SP technicians understand medical terminology with its numerous prefixes, roots and suffixes, they will be able to better understand the surgical procedures referred to in surgery schedules and the instruments and supplies that will be requested. Challenges arise when the OR is supplied with incorrect instrumentation and supplies for a surgical procedure. When the OR receives a case cart for a scheduled procedure with the incorrect instrumentation and supplies, the surgical team's attention is diverted away from the patient and to getting the correct items into the room.

**PROCEDURE APPROACH AND PURPOSE**

When reading surgery schedules and interacting with OR staff, SP technicians need to understand how procedure approach and purpose are identified. When a surgical procedure is referred to in a surgery schedule, the suffix attached to the primary medical term will indicate the purpose of the procedure. For example, "oscopy" will refer to visual examination of and possible treatment, "otomy" will refer to an incision into, "ectomy" will refer to removal of, and "plasty" will refer to repair/reconstruction of.

Another key element in how a procedure can be understood relates to the approach the surgeon will use when performing the surgery. The approach or method typically comes at the beginning of the surgical procedure term. The following are some examples:

-   **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: will remove the patient's gallbladder using laparoscopic instrumentation and techniques.
-   **Robotic-assisted prostatectomy**: will remove the patient's prostate by using robotic instrumentation and techniques. Bilateral myringotomy will make incisions for drainage into the patient's tympanic membrane, also known as the eardrum, on both sides.
-   **Anterior cervical fusion:** will fuse some of the patient’s cervical vertebrae, approaching from the front of the patient's body.
-   **Posterior lumbar interbody fusion**: will fuse some of the patient's lumbar vertebrae, approaching from the back of the patient.
-   **Vaginal hysterectomy**: will remove the patient's uterus via the vaginal canal.
-   **Total abdominal hysterectomy**: will remove the uterus through an open incision in the abdomen.

**Sterile Processing Technicians and the Surgery Schedule**

SP technicians may be responsible for reading the OR surgery schedule to print pick lists, obtain the needed instrumentation and find/obtain instrumentation that is already in use in another surgical procedure. Surgery schedules are prioritized according to patient needs.

**CONCLUSION**

Knowledge of medical terminology is essential for ensuring that SP technicians have a clear understanding of what the OR and other healthcare customers require for their procedures. Prefixes, roots and suffixes are vital tools that will allow SP technicians to communicate more proficiently.
