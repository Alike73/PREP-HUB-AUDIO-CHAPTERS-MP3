INTRODUCTION

Once an item has been properly cleaned, there are some decisions to make. Is the item safe for its intended use or does it need further processing? If further processing is needed, what type of processing does it need and how can that be accomplished? Sterile Processing technicians must be able to identify the type of bactericidal process needed and select the method that will provide that process and perform it effectively.

This chapter will provide basic information on disinfectants and disinfecting processes that are frequently used in Sterile Processing departments or SPDs.

INTRODUCTION TO DISINFECTANTS

The Spaulding Classification System

The selection of a disinfectant must be based, in part, upon the intended use of the device and the degree of disinfection required for that device. The Spaulding Classification System divides patient care items into three categories, each based on the degree of risk of infection when the items are used in patient care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation or A A MI use the Spaulding Classification System in their guidelines and standards.

**The three Spaulding categories are:**

-   **Critical items,** are Instruments or devices introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other sterile areas of the body.

Examples include surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implants. These items must be sterilized before use.

-   **Semi-critical items, are** items that come in contact with intact mucous membranes. They do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces. Examples include non-invasive flexible fiberoptic endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, and anesthesia breathing circuits. Semi-critical items should be sterilized, if possible. However, if sterilization is not possible, the item, at a minimum, must undergo a high level disinfection or H L D process. H L D can be expected to destroy all microbial organisms, but not necessarily microbial spores.
-   **Non critical items, are** items that come into direct contact with the patient's unbroken skin. Examples include crutches and countertops. These items require thorough cleaning and, in some cases, low-level disinfection to intermediate-level disinfection.
-   **Bactericidal:** A substance that kills bacteria.
-   **Disinfectant:** A chemical that kills most pathogenic organisms but does not kill all spores.
-   **Disinfection, is** The destruction of nearly all pathogenic microorganisms on an inanimate (non-living) surface.
-   **Spaulding Classification System:** is A system developed by Doctor Spaulding, that divides medical devices into three categories based on the risk of infection involved with their use.
-   **Sterile or Sterilization:** Completely devoid of all living microorganisms.
-   **High level disinfection or HLD), is** The destruction of all vegetative microorganisms. But not bacterial spores.
-   **Low level disinfection, is** The destruction of some vegetative forms of bacteria.
-   **Intermediate level disinfection, is** The destruction of viruses, mycobacteria, fungi and vegetative bacteria, but not bacterial spores.

**There is no single disinfectant that will work for all situations**. That is why every SPD should have more than one disinfectant to choose from in the work area. SP technicians must be able to select the appropriate disinfectant for the job. To do so, a basic understanding of the different types of disinfectants is needed.

Caution

Before using a chemical disinfectant, be sure to review the manufacturer's IFU. Using the correct chemical the wrong way is just as dangerous as using the wrong chemical.

SAFE WORK PRACTICES WHEN PERFORMING MANUAL DISINFECTION

No matter which disinfectant is chosen, failure lo use a disinfectant properly, according to the manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU), can result in failure 01the disinfection process, which puts both patients and staff at risk.

Work Area Setup

**Disinfection processes** should be performed only in designated areas that are separated from the area used for cleaning. The workflow should help ensure that the item(s) being processed are not re-contaminated during or upon completion of the disinfection process.

Any accessories needed for the disinfection process, such as measuring devices, soaking bins and timers, should be collected prior to beginning the process. If cloths are used, they should be of clean, non-linting materials. Quality testing should be performed to ensure equipment is operating as intended. For example, automated dosing dispensers, suction irrigation devices, and automated preprocessors.

Read labels carefully

Labels

Since chemical disin1eclants have different capabilities, it is important to read the product labels to ensure they are used appropriately. Check the IFU of the disinfectant and medical device(s) to be processed to ensure compatibility.

Disinfectants used in healthcare facilities are harsh chemicals. It is important to read and follow all safety precautions.

Preparation Instructions

In addition to choosing the appropriate disinfectant, there are various factors that are vital to the success of chemical disinfection. Cleaning and disin1ecting chemicals cannot be mixed with other chemicals because the mixture may produce a lethal chemical.

**When preparing disinfectant solutions, check the label for essential preparation instructions, which include:**

-   The expiration date.
-   Reuse by date of the chemical.
-   Appropriate concentration for use, diluted or full strength.
-   Dilution or mixing requirements
-   Correct temperature required for the disinfectant
-   Water quality and pH requirements
-   Device Preparation

The device needs to be prepared for disinfection. It must be thoroughly cleaned to allow complete exposure to the disinfectant, and dried to prevent additional water from diluting the disinfectant. Multi-part devices should be disassembled to allow full contact of the disinfectant.

Important Safety Note

While manufacturers may combine chemicals to create a more effective disinfectant, SP technicians should never mix chemicals on their own. Some common chemicals can be lethal when combined.

Contact

Disinfectants are not effective unless they make direct contact with all surfaces of the device. Improper cleaning will leave organic matter, which prevents direct contact with the disinfectant. Lack of contact through improper application or because soil remains on a device will result in a failed disinfection process.

Direct contact may be impeded if items are not disassembled properly or if they are only partially submerged in a disinfectant soak solution. When disinfecting a lumen, care must be taken to ensure there are no air bubbles in the lumen that would prevent the disinfectant from contacting all interior surfaces of the lumen.

Exposure Time

Exposure times vary by type and concentration of disinfectant. Many times, the term wet contact is stated in the IFU. This means the amount of time the device must remain wet with the disinfectant. Use a timer to ensure the proper exposure time is met.

What Is Wet Contact Time?

Wet contact time means that the item must remain wet with the disinfectant for the entire stated contact time. If the disinfectant evaporates or the item is allowed to dry before the total contact exposure time is met, the disinfectant must be reapplied, and the exposure time must begin again.

Rinsing

Disinfectants require a rinsing process. Critical water is preferred for non-critical items and is required for semi critical and critical items unless sterile water is specified by the manufacturer's written IFU. Care should be taken to thoroughly rinse all surfaces according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Drying

After the cleaning and disinfection processes, items should be dried completely with clean, non-linting cloths. Lumened instruments should be dried with pressure-regulated, forced instrument air or high efficiency particulate air (HEPA-filtered air), until no moisture is observed. Medical devices should never be stored wet because wet storage supports the growth of microorganisms and biofilms.

Storage and Transport

Following the disinfection process, items are placed into storage or transported for use. The storage area should be designated for patient-ready items and separated from the decontamination area or room. It should be clean, well-ventilated and free from dust, and devices should be stored in a manner that protects them from damage or contamination. They should be identified as being patient ready. These items should be transported in a manner that prevents contamination such as having a clean cover over them or placed in a clean container.

Containers

When using chemicals, it sometimes seems more efficient to pour chemicals from the larger, original container lo a smaller, easier-to-handle container. Check with the department manager to determine if this practice is acceptable, and also check the department's procedure for labeling. All containers need to be properly labeled.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PRACTICES FOR DISINFECTION

In addition to reading and following the manufacturer's IFU when performing disinfection processes, other quality assurance practices should be in place. Those practices should help ensure that disinfection processes are performed correctly, safely and according to product-specific requirements.

Education

All technicians who perform disinfection activities should be trained and able to meet competencies for each disinfection process they perform. Each time a new product or process is introduced into the work area, training must be performed, and competencies must be completed.

Safety

Patient and employee safety is of concern when performing disinfection processes. Improperly disinfected medical devices pose a risk to patients. The harsh chemicals and fumes associated with chemical disinfection can pose a safety risk to SP technicians.

**It is important to understand the following recommendations for handling disinfectants:**

-   Personal protective equipment requirements
-   Environmental or ventilation requirements
-   Spill and leak procedures
-   Storage requirements
-   Disposal requirements

Spill Kits

When working with chemicals, safety precautions should be in place. It is a requirement of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Code of Federal Regulations that a spill kit be available and that an emergency action plan be implemented in the event of a chemical spill.

The spill plan should be for a worst-case scenario and provide instructions on how to handle a spill. The plan should also ensure employees are trained to respond appropriately. The reaction to a chemical spill depends upon the composition and volume of the chemical spilled, where the spill occurred, the resources needed and the personnel's level of training.

TYPES OF DISINFECTANTS

The term "disinfection" is a generic term used to describe a process. Within that process are products that perform at different levels.

The following is a review of common disinfectants used in SPDs and the level (type) of disinfection they are designed to provide.

Low-Level and Intermediate-Level Disinfectants

Items requiring low-level or intermediate-level disinfection only come in contact with intact skin. These items usually only touch the outside of the body, this includes items like, crutches and countertops. Low and intermediate level disinfectants may also be used on hard environmental surfaces and some mobile equipment. This group of disinfectants commonly includes quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohols, phenolics, chlorines and iodophors.

**Low level to intermediate level disinfectants have one important thing in common,** the germicidal action of each is reduced by the presence of organic materials.

**Organic materials Compounds** containing oxygen, carbon and hydrogen; derived from living organisms. Organic matter in the form of serum, blood, pus, or fecal material can interfere with the activity of disinfectants.

No Soil

The germicidal action of disinfectants is reduced by the presence of soil.

NO, Blood • Fluids • Feces • Tissue • Pus • Etcetera

Quaternary Ammonium Compounds

Quaternary ammonium compounds (commonly called "quats") are low-level disinfectants. The most common chemical in most quats is benzalkonium chloride. Quats are incompatible with soap. Soap is not recommended for use in the SP decontamination process because of the residue it leaves behind.

Some quats are absorbed by materials such as cotton and filter paper. A quat that is absorbed by cotton should not be used with cotton towels, cloths or mop heads. It is important to consult the specific quat's IFU to determine if cotton and/or paper can be used with them.

Alcohol

Alcohol can be used as both an antiseptic and a disinfectant. Both ethyl and isopropyl or rubbing alcohol have good disinfecting properties. One of the challenges when using alcohol as a disinfectant is that to achieve a reasonable level of disinfection the alcohol must remain in wet contact with the surface of the object being disinfected for a minimum of five minutes. Alcohol evaporates quickly, and maintaining wet contact for an extended period of time can be difficult. Alcohol can also act as a fixative for debris on surfaces, making the debris more difficult to remove.

Antiseptic or Disinfectant?

Antiseptics are used on living tissue such as skin, for example, receiving an alcohol prep before an annual flu shot. Disinfectants are used on inanimate or non living objects, for example, disinfecting a piece of equipment between uses.

Phenolics

Phenolics are intermediate level to low-level disinfectants containing phenol. Phenolic compounds have long been the agent of choice for Environmental Services departments. Because of the phenolic residue left after use, that residue can be reactivated later by damp mopping; however, this same residual film can become a problem when left on medical devices.

For example, irritation of sensitive skin can occur after exposure to phenolic residues. Like all disinfectants, phenolics require a specific time for wet contact for maximum disinfectant effectiveness.

Stainless steel instruments should not be subjected to strong phenolics for a prolonged period of time because phenolics can be corrosive. Some plastics also react poorly to phenolics. Follow the device manufacturer's IFU for the types of materials that can withstand disinfection with phenolics.

Chlorine

Chlorine is an intermediate-level disinfectant that is commonly used for the treatment of water and sewage. Chlorine, a member of the halogen family, may be found in SPDs as a hypochlorite solution and is often recommended for biohazard clean-up procedures; however, chlorine is not considered a disinfectant of choice for SP due to its corrosive qualities. Metal instruments subjected to chlorine may have their finishes damaged by exposure to a chlorine solution.

Summary of Chlorine

**Uses:**

-   A 1 to10 dilution of 0.25 percent sodium hypo chloride has been recommended by the CDC for cleaning blood spills
-   Must remain wet on items to be disinfected one to two and a half minutes

Iodophors

Iodophors are buffered iodides that are also members of the halogen family. Like alcohol, iodophors are used both as antiseptics and disinfectants. The best-known and most widely used iodophor is povidone iodine. Iodophors can stain both skin and patient equipment. Iodophors should not be used on surgical instruments.

**Advantages:**

-   Bactericidal, virucidal and tuberculocidal
-   Rapid action against vegetative bacteria

**Disadvantages:**

-   Corrosive to metals unless combined with anti-corrosive agents when formulated
-   Detrimental to some plastics
-   Stains fabrics and other material
-   May require long contact time to kill some fungi

**Uses:**

-   A 1 to 10 dilution used in skin preparations
-   Disinfection of some equipment
-   The corrosive nature of iodine on metals and some plastics limits its uses a primary disinfectant in Sterile Processing.
-   Must remain wet on items to be disinfected for at least two minutes. A dilution of .2 percent sodium hypo chloride has been recommended by the CDC for cleaning blood spills
-   Must remain wet on items to be disinfected one to two and a half minutes

High-Level Disinfectants

High level disinfectants are used to process semi-critical items that may come in contact with mucous membranes of the body. There are several types of disinfectants in this category.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the FDA regulates high level disinfectants and liquid chemical sterilants used to process medical devices and surgical instruments.

The FDA uses the term liquid chemical sterilant along with the term high-level disinfectant because, in some cases, the chemical can provide sterilization if the soak time is extended. This information is provided in the IFU.

Some HLD and LCS products are designed for single use, while others are designed for reuse. This information is provided in the IFU. Only HLD or LCS products labeled for reuse can be reused.

Like their low level and intermediate-level counterparts, high­ level disinfectants are inactivated by organic materials; therefore, thorough cleaning is critical to successful outcomes. Medical devices should be thoroughly rinsed and flushed to remove residual debris and cleaning solutions.

After rinsing, devices should be thoroughly dried using a clean, lint-free cloth or dried with instrument air or HEPA-filtered air in accordance with the device's IFU. Failing to follow the manufacturer's IFU can jeopardize the effectiveness of the disinfection process or the device's performance.

As with other disinfectants, SP technicians must understand the differences between high-level disinfectants and how to use them effectively. The following section provides some basic information about high-level disinfectants. As with all disinfectants, consult individual manufacturer's IFU before attempting to process items.

Glutaraldehyde

Glutaraldehyde is a high level disinfectant used for semi-critical devices. Glutaraldehyde is compatible with materials used in many modern medical devices and can be used to process medical devices containing heat-sensitive materials. Glutaraldehyde is usually a clear liquid that turns color when activated and it has a sharp, pungent odor. It is a strong irritant to the skin, eyes and respiratory system. Nitrile or butyl gloves and face and eye protection should be used when working with glutaraldehyde.

Activated Process by which a solution is combined with an activating chemical before use. Glutaraldehyde, for example, must be mixed with an activating solution before use.

Following immersion in a glutaraldehyde solution, instructions for rinsing items should be carefully followed to ensure the chemical is completely removed. Care must be taken to ensure that the item is not re-contaminated.

Glutaraldehyde should be used in a separate, designated area, apart from the decontamination area. Any room where glutaraldehyde is used should be well-ventilated, with a minimum of 10 air exchanges per hour. When a dedicated area is not available, glutaraldehyde disinfection may be performed at an enclosed workstation. These self-contained workstations manage air flow and reduce exposure to fumes.

Unused glutaraldehyde solution should be stored in a cool, secure location and in tightly closed, properly marked containers that contain the activation date.

Glutaraldehyde-based products can be used in automated or manual H L D processes. Most glutaraldehyde-based disinfectants are labeled for reuse for 14 to 28 days. During the recommended reuse period, the efficacy of the glutaraldehyde in the solution should be tested with test strips recommended by the manufacturer. If the solution falls below its minimum effective concentration or MEC level, it should be discarded, regardless of how many days the solution has been in use.

Glutaraldehyde vapors increase whenever the solution is agitated such as when it is poured into or dumped out of a soaking bin. Exposure levels for SP technicians during disposal can be reduced by adding a glutaraldehyde neutralizing agent to the solution prior to disposal. Consult state and local requirements and the manufacturer's IFU for proper disposal measures, ventilation requirements and potential exposure monitoring.

Minimum effective concentration or MEC, is The percentage concentration of the active ingredient in a disinfectant or chemical sterilant that is the minimum concentration at which the chemical meets all its label claims for activity against specific microorganisms.

Summary of Glutaraldehyde

**Advantages:**

-   Can be discarded down facility drains in accordance with local regulations
-   14 day reuse life
-   Requires no activation or Mixing
-   Solution is compatible with a wide range of endoscopes and other medical devices

**Disadvantages:**

-   Does not have a sterilant label claim

**Uses:**

-   Semi critical item such as laryngoscope blades and flexible fiberoptic endoscopes

Ortho-Phtha lal de hyde

Ortho phtha lal de hyde commonly called OPA is a high-level disinfectant that provides a fast and effective way to disinfect a wide range of devices. Before processing any urological instrumentation, consult the IFU; OPA has been associated with anaphylactic-like reactions in bladder cancer patients.

The OPA solution may be used and reused within the limitations indicated by the manufacturer for up to 14 days. The efficacy of the OPA solution should be tested with test strips recommended by the manufacturer before each use. If the solution falls below its MEC level, it should be discarded, regardless of how many days the solution has been in use.

Following immersion in OPA solution, instructions for rinsing items should be carefully followed to ensure the chemical is completely removed. Care must be taken to ensure that the item is not re-contaminated.

Summary of OPA

**Advantages:**

-   Kills vegetative bacteria usually within two minutes
-   Bactericidal gram positive and gram negative, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal and sporicidal
-   For sterilization and killing spores, the soak time is six to 70 hours
-   The manufacturer's recommendations should be consulted

**Disadvantages:**

-   Noxious odors: good ventilation is required
-   Unstable
-   14 or 28 day product life
-   Dilution of product reduces the activity necessary for high­ level disinfection

**Uses:**

-   Semi-critical items such as laryngoscope blades, flexible endoscopes, etc.

Hydrogen Peroxide

**Hydrogen peroxide:** is a broad-spectrum high-level disinfectant that is available in different concentrations. As with other high level disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide efficacy must be monitored by regularly testing the MEC. Follow the manufacturer's IFU for specific instructions.

Summary of Hydrogen Peroxide

**Advantages:**

-   Can be used as a sterilant at the right concentrations
-   Broad-spectrum HLD.
-   Kills bacteria and viruses, including norovirus, rotavirus, R S V, M R S A and TB

**Disadvantages:**

-   Corrosive to some materials

**Uses:**

-   Disinfection of hard and soft surfaces

Peracetic Acid

This chemical achieves HLO in five minutes at room temperature. Some dilutions are designed to be used in a manufacturer-specific automated endoscope preprocessor or the A E R as a sterilant only. Peracetic acid is compatible with many materials, it is also known to be corrosive, users must check with the device manufacturer to determine material compatibility.

**Follow the manufacturer's IFU for specific instructions.**

Summary of Parasetic Acid

**Advantages:**

-   Compatible with many materials
-   Broad spectrum HLD
-   May be used as a sterilant in the appropriate AER

**Disadvantages:**

-   Corrosive to some materials

**Uses:**

-   HLD of laryngoscope blades, endoscopes

ACHIEVING DISINFECTION USING MECHANICAL PROCESSES

Mechanical HLD processes are the preferred method over manual processes because they are consistent and reduce errors related to human factors, while also reducing the risk for chemical exposure. Mechanical HLD involves placing the cleaned medical device into a mechanical system as specified by the manufacturer's written IFU and selecting the appropriate processing cycle. Mechanical processing equipment can be semi­ automatic or fully automatic. They often provide documentation of the cycle, which should be maintained.

Washer-Disinfectors

The most common mechanical disinfection process is the one carried out in washer-disinfectors. These automated washers provide a cleaning process followed by a thermal disinfection process. Thermal disinfection uses heat to reduce the number of microorganisms on items such as surgical instruments and utensils.

Water temperature is the key source of disinfection in any automatic washer that claims to provide thermal disinfection. The exposure time and temperature used to achieve thermal disinfection differs by brand of washer. Check the manufacturer's IFU and the washer operator's manual for specific information.

Pasteurizers

Pasteurization equipment provides disinfection at water temperatures of I 50°F to I70°F (65°C to 77°C). The temperature is maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes of exposure to the medical devices. Items must be able to withstand immersion in solution and be thoroughly cleaned prior to placing them in a pasteurizing unit. Water temperature and exposure time must be closely monitored.

Automated Endoscope Preprocessors

Or A E Rs, make the process of disinfecting flexible fiber optic endoscopes and some transesophageal echocardiography probes simpler and safer.

A E Rs offer several advantages over manual processing. First, they reduce personnel exposure to the H L D disinfectant and its vapors. Their use may also increase quality assurance by providing consistent processes and documenting several cycle parameters.

**Advantages of most AERs include:**

-   Consistent exposure to the cleaning agent
-   Timed contact with the liquid chemical disinfectant
-   Continuous movement of the high level disinfectant
-   Use of an air flush cycle to remove excess moisture
-   Use of copious and consistent amounts of rinse water
-   Documentation of the cycle parameters

Endoscope design limitations create the need for some manual reprocessing steps. Since most AERs do not completely dry endoscopes, additional drying is required after cycle completion. Refer to the AER's operating manual for information about limitations of automated cycles.

**When using an AER:**

-   Follow the endoscope manufacturer's IFU for proper manual cleaning prior to placing the endoscope in an AER
-   Use the correct tubing and adapters and follow the manufacturer's instructions to connect the endoscope to the AER
-   Place valves and other removable parts in the AER, if possible
-   Follow the manufacturer's IFU for the types of disinfectants and their proper use
-   Set the AER for the recommended cycle time

Liquid Chemical Sterilant Processing Systems

A liquid chemical sterilant or LCS processing system utilizes a specific type of sterilant concentrate as recommended in the system's IFU. This type of processor provides a validated mechanical liquid sterilization system. Specialized tubing and adaptors are available to connect specific lumened items to the system so the required sterilant and rinse water reach all surfaces and angles of the device.

Critical items, such as bronchoscopes, that undergo LCS are used immediately after processing. Critical devices that are not used immediately should be processed again when removed from storage before use.

Probe Processors

Probes are medical devices that are used in body cavities or that may have contact with non-intact skin. Some examples include transvaginal ultrasound probes, transrectal ultrasound probes and transesophageal echocardiography or T E E probes. These probes are classified as intermediate risk items because they come in contact with intact mucous membranes. Unlike flexible endoscopes, these probes are not usually fully immersible; however, as with flexible endoscopes, they can be processed either manually or mechanically.

The mechanical probe processors available are designed to perform HLD on probes. These systems use a high-level disinfectant where adequate concentrations can be monitored using an indicator, along with a printout or digital record to show the efficacy of the cycle.

Removing HLD Items from Processing Equipment,

After items have undergone HLD/LCS, they should be handled in a manner that prevents contamination and damage. PPE should be removed, hand hygiene should be performed, and clean, non­ latex gloves should be donned prior to handling the endoscope/ probe. Carefully dry the device and place it in a transport device for immediate delivery or place the device into storage.

Storage,

Proper storage of items after H L D or LCS is important to ensure the items are safe for patient use. Semi-critical devices like gastroscopes should be stored in an approved cabinet that is clean, well-ventilated and dust free in order to keep them dry and prevent exposure to potentially hazardous microbial contamination. Endoscopes should be stored in a manner that protects them from damage or contamination, and disinfected items should be completely dry when placed into storage. Each endoscope should be identified as being patient-ready, as it distinguishes clean and disinfected items from non-processed items.

The storage time at each facility differs; therefore, the policy and procedure should specify the amount of time an HLD or LCS item can be in storage before reprocessing.

Transportation of H L D and L C S Devices

To protect the endoscope from contamination when removing HLD/LCS items from storage, the SP technician should perform hand hygiene and don (put on) new, clean, non-latex gloves. The processed item should be identified as clean and protected from contamination and damage.

QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTING FOR HIGH LEVEL DISINFECTANTS

High-level disinfectants are much more complex chemicals than low- to intermediate-level disinfectants, and the items processed in these chemicals are used in semi-critical areas of the body. It is important to monitor these chemicals to ensure they are performing as expected and to document the results of that monitoring.

Minimum Effective Concentration Testing

Is performed to determine if the high level disinfectant can be reused, it is important to test the solution with a chemical indicator. The disinfectants must be tested prior to each use, and the results must be clearly documented. Chemical indicators are developed to be used for specific products. Be certain to use the correct indicator for the solution being tested. Follow specific manufacturer testing protocol and carefully document all MEC testing.

Documentation,

In addition to documenting the high-level disinfectant's MEC, concise documentation must be kept to enable tracking of the disinfected items to the patient receiving the items. A manual or computerized record should be maintained when using H L D.

**Documentation should at least contain:**

-   Lot number of the H L D process, including the A E R or soak basin number
-   Items being disinfected, including quantities and device serial numbers, if applicable
-   Patient name or identifier
-   Physician's name and procedure
-   HLD solution information, including activation or dilution date and the last date the solution may be used, unless M E C efficacy testing fails before that date
-   Exposure time and temperature, if manually soaking
-   Date and time of the process
-   Technician identification
-   MEC test strip results

**Disinfectants:**

-   Are not all the same
-   Must be appropriate for the job

Are only effective when used accordingly to direction

In CONCLUSION,

Performing any successful disinfection process is much more difficult than it may appear. Careful attention to detail from the initial cleaning process through the completion of the disinfection process is critical to achieve desired results. SP technicians must select the appropriate disinfectant designed for the job they want to do, prepare the items properly and use the disinfectant as directed to ensure the safety of staff and patients. The success or failure of any disinfection process depends on the knowledge of the SP technician and their attention to detail.
