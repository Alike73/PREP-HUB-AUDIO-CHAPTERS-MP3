INTRODUCTION

Cleaning is the cornerstone of instrument processing. Items that have not been cleaned properly cannot be sterilized or made safe for patient use. The cleaning processes performed in the Sterile Processing department or the SPD, are very different than the cleaning processes carried out in other situations.

When cleaning is performed outside the healthcare facility (for example, in home settings), the definition of clean can vary with the individual. When cleaning is performed in the healthcare facility, it must be performed consistently and to the highest level. Improper cleaning can cause infections and even death. This chapter will examine the cleaning process-from the tools required to perform cleaning to the basic steps necessary to carry out a successful process.

WHAT IS CLEAN?

Cleaning is defined as the removal of all visible and non-visible soil and other foreign material from medical devices being reprocessed. When faced with the complex configurations of today's medical devices, the cleaning process becomes quite challenging. Some soils are easy to see and remove; others are not. The goal of the cleaning process in the decontamination area is to remove all soils and residues, not just ones that are easy to see and remove.

Proper cleaning requires the correct tools and technique and attention to detail. A medical device may appear clean at first glance but may harbor soils that are not readily visible. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to properly clean any area that cannot be seen. Lumens and other areas that do not provide good access for cleaning pose a significant challenge to Sterile Processing technicians. The configuration of this instrument makes it difficult or even impossible to see all areas for cleaning.

Borescopes should be used to view the internal surfaces of these types of instruments. Even when item surfaces are clearly visible, inadequate cleaning can occur. Although the clamp appears visibly clean, several areas of concern are identified. The yellow and orange areas indicate residual soil.

These examples illustrate that even simple instruments can pose a significant cleaning challenge. Every item that undergoes the decontamination process has the potential to harm a patient or present a danger to healthcare workers.

That is why SP technicians assigned to the **decontamination area** must have the proper cleaning tools, understand the correct cleaning technique for every item and always pay close attention to detail as they perform their duties.

-   **Decontamination area is a central** location within a healthcare facility designated for the collection, retention and cleaning of soiled and contaminated items.

INTRODUCTION TO THE DECONTAMINATION AREA

This section provides an overview of the decontamination area and the equipment and processes needed to accomplish thorough cleaning.

Design and Location of the Decontamination Area

The process of cleaning and decontamination begins long before even one soiled instrument arrives in the decontamination area. A great deal of planning and preparation goes into the design and set up of the work area and the acquisition of cleaning equipment, tools and supplies. SP technicians assigned to the decontamination area should be aware of the processes and safeguards used to facilitate the cleaning of soiled items, reduce the spread of microorganisms and ensure the safety of patients and employees.

Decontamination areas are unique because of their purpose and design. Soiled instruments should only be cleaned in a designated decontamination area. The decontamination area serves as a receiving area for soiled instruments and, in many cases, other medical devices and equipment from surgery and other areas of the healthcare facility. Several design-related factors must be considered as the decontamination area is planned. It is more cost effective to centralize the decontamination function to one area of the healthcare facility. If the decontamination area is not centralized, inconsistent practices and additional expenses will be incurred for duplicate equipment and space.

The location of the decontamination area should factor in the need to transport contaminated devices from the point of use. Proper transportation of contaminated devices is necessary to reduce the risk of cross-contamination and exposure to bloodborne pathogens. In many cases, the decontamination area is located near the Operating Room or OR, because most soiled instruments are generated there.

Decontamination Engineering Controls

Spills and splashes are a common occurrence in the decontamination area and create the need for frequent surface cleaning and disinfection. Specific engineering controls are designed to make the work area safe and efficient. Floors and walls in the decontamination area should be constructed with materials that can tolerate cleaning chemicals. Walls should not be constructed of particulate or fiber-shedding materials. Maintaining the decontamination environment is important to the cleaning process.

The healthcare organization monitors room temperature and humidity based on the version of ANSI 170, that was current at the time the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system was initially installed or last upgraded. The healthcare facility should have a process for monitoring H V A C performance parameters and a mechanism for identifying and resolving variances.

The ventilation system should allow for no less than 10 air exchanges per hour, and the decontamination area should be under negative pressure in relation to other areas adjacent to the decontamination area. Negative air pressure inside the room is lower than the air pressure outside the room, causing the air to flow into the room with lower (negative) air pressure.

Lighting is essential to a safe work environment and is a key element in the cleaning process. Instrument cleaning requires attention to detail, and lighting must be adequate for technicians to perform inspections associated with the cleaning process. Detailed inspection of instrumentation may require a higher level of illumination than activities performed in other areas of the department. Lighting should be installed to avoid shadows and allow the maximum light over the inspection area.

Personal protective equipment or PPE

-   Hair covering
-   Eye protection, such as goggles or eyeglasses with solid side shields, or a chin-length face shield
-   Fluid-resistant face mask
-   A gown with reinforced cuffs and a front that acts as a barrier to fluids
-   Strong general-purpose utility gloves that cover the cuffs of the reinforced gown and can resist cuts and tears
-   Skid-resistant decontamination shoe covers
-   Employer-provided cloth scrub attire that is changed at the end of each shift or when wet or soiled

**Humidity, is the** Amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of vapor the atmosphere could hold without condensation.

**Negative pressure, is** Air pressure inside the room that is lower than the air pressure outside the room, causing the air to flow into the room with the lower or negative air pressure.

An emergency eyewash or shower station should be quickly and easily accessible, and be located within 10 Seconds or 30 meters of any areas with potential chemical exposure.

Eyewash stations cannot have their access blocked and cannot be placed in a decontamination sink.

Eyewash/shower stations should be activated weekly for a period long enough to verify they are performing to standards. This routine testing should be documented.

The decontamination area is the central point for handling contaminated devices, and a high microbial count will be present in the environment. The first line of defense for reducing contaminates is maintaining as clean a work area as possible. Special attention should be given to the cleaning procedures in the work area.

**For example:**

Horizontal work surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at least at the beginning or end of each shift and as needed.

Spills should be spot cleaned immediately.

-   Floors should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily
-   All trash and soiled linens should be removed per facility policy
-   Sinks should be cleaned and disinfected per facility policy
-   **Biohazardous waste** should be removed per facility policy

Adequate storage for equipment used to clean the decontamination area should be available and tools, such as mops, used in this area should not be used in other areas of the department.

**Biohazardous waste, is any** Waste containing infectious agents that present a risk or potential risk to human health. Such as anything containing Blood or other human liquids or solids.

The space for donning and doffing PPE should be in a designated area, preferably outside of the decontamination work area, adjacent to the decontamination room.

Handwashing and frequent use of appropriate hand germicidal agents are required. Whenever SP technicians remove PPE, they should properly wash their hands. A sink dedicated to hand hygiene should be provided within the decontamination area and it should be separated from sinks used to sort and prepare instruments for processing.

Before any new staff member is assigned to the decontamination area, they must receive a thorough and comprehensive orientation.

Effective, ongoing education and training is critical to the safe processing of medical devices. Following all safety protocols is the ongoing responsibility of both the employer and all SP technicians.

Traffic Control and Environmental Management

Technicians assigned to the decontamination area should be constantly vigilant of their surroundings. Traffic should be restricted to personnel working in the area, and access to the area should be controlled.

Traffic control is imperative due to the potential for exposure to bloodborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals.

Employee safety is always an important concern. Since SP technicians do not know the origin of the contamination, they must assume that every item received in the decontamination area can pose a potential risk. For these reasons, following personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements is essential.

Work Area Setup

Preparation of the work area is an essential first step in promoting safety and efficiency in the decontamination area.

Sinks

Ideally, each workstation will have three sink bays for washing, intermediate rinsing and final rinsing. If three bays are not available, the cleaning process must be modified. The workflow should always move from dirty to clean.

**A three-sink arrangement used for manual cleaning should consist of:**

-   **A wash sink:** with water and detergent or enzymatic solution. Fill water should have a temperature range of 80° Fahrenheit to 110° Fahrenheit. Temperature monitors should be used to verify that the cleaning solution maintains the correct temperature. Water hardness, pH, temperature, and the type of soil present on instrumentation impact the effectiveness of enzyme cleaners and detergents.

**Note**: The detergent manufacturer's instructions for use or IFUs must always be followed.

All cleaning chemicals must be mixed per the manufacturer's instructions. Marking the sink to indicate gallon levels can prevent mistakes

-   **A second sink, also known as the** intermediate rinse sink, must contain **utility** or **critical** water. After cleaning, devices should be thoroughly rinsed to further assist in removing gross soil, debris and detergent residue. This rinse water should be changed frequently, so the cleaning chemicals do not build up and reattach to the instruments being rinsed.
-   **A third sink, also known as the** final rinse sink, should only contain critical water. This helps prevent instrument spotting, rinse off cleaning chemical residues and prevent the redepositing of minerals and microbes.
-   **Utility water, is any** Water that comes from the tap, and may need further treatment to achieve the required standards. This water is mainly used for flushing, washing and rinsing.
-   **Critical water, is** Water that has been extensively treated and or filtered to ensure that microorganisms, organic and inorganic materials and minerals are removed.

Effective cleaning of soiled devices is critical to decontamination. Cleaning and rinsing should result in decreased pathogens and no visible bioburden, which is essential to the effectiveness of disinfection and terminal sterilization.

**Cleaning Tools**

Water

Although water is frequently taken for granted and not often considered a tool, water quality makes a significant difference in instrument and equipment cleaning outcomes. Poor water quality can impact the performance of chemicals used for cleaning and disinfection and it can also affect the rinse phase by leaving deposits on items that have been cleaned.

There are many impurities in water, even in tap water treated at a municipal water treatment plant. Water from any source typically contains minerals, dissolved solids, particles, gases and organic and inorganic chemicals. Some water sources also contain bacteria, algae and parasites. These contaminants may impede the cleaning and **biocidal** processes and, in some cases, contaminants may shorten the life of instruments by harming their finish.

-   **Biocide, is** A substance or microorganism that kills or controls the growth of living organisms such as Bacteria.

Critical water is extensively treated, typically by a multistep treatment process that may include a carbon bed, softening, and **reverse osmosis or RO. This** process can be followed by either **deionization or distillation,** to ensure that the microorganisms and inorganic and organic material are removed from the water.

There are chemical performance qualification levels of water quality for medical device processing that should be monitored by the Facilities Engineering department.

-   **Reverse osmosis or RO, is** A water purification process by which impurities are removed from water using a semipermeable membrane or a fine filter usually smaller than .02 microns.
-   **Deionized water, is** Water that has had all ions removed through an ion exchange process.
-   **Distilled water, is** Water that is heated to steam, then allowed to cool and condense. Leaving behind all minerals, metals, chemicals and microorganisms

Critical water should be used as a final rinse in any cleaning process to reduce or eliminate unwanted chemicals and pathogens. Water test sampling should be performed at each site where critical water is used as a final rinse.

Knowing the condition of the water used to process instruments allows facilities to make appropriate choices in the selection of cleaning and disinfecting chemicals. Many chemicals used in the decontamination process require specific pH ranges.

Manual Cleaning Tools

Decontamination requires a combination of manual and mechanical cleaning processes; therefore, the area will have equipment for both types of cleaning. This section provides information about manual cleaning tools.

Brushes

Brushes are available in many diameters and lengths. Some must be rigid, and others must be flexible to properly clean the many different lumens, channels and crevices in instruments. Brushes used for cleaning usually have nylon bristles. Brushes are also available with sponge tips and other configurations.

Ideally, disposable brushes should be used. If reusable brushes are used, they should be decontaminated per the IFU to ensure they are not a source of contamination. Abrasive brushes should never be used because they can scratch the surface of the instrument and accelerate corrosion. Metal or wire brushes should only be used if indicated in the instrument's IFU.

Correct brush size is also critical. In fact, it is essential that during the review of new instrumentation for purchase or evaluation, the IFU should be reviewed for the correct size and type of brush to use. Consider lumen cleaning, for example: if the brush is too large, it will not fit into the lumen. If the brush is too small, it will not have complete contact with the lumen walls and will not clean them thoroughly. The brush must also be long enough to pass through the lumen. Brushes that are worn should be discarded.

Cleaning Cloths

Use of a non-linting cloth is recommended because it reduces the risk of lint fibers being left on instruments. Cloths should be changed regularly or when visibly soiled or stained.

Sponges

Sponges can be used to clean some medical devices. Some sponges are impregnated with detergents and should be used according to the manufacturer's IFU. The sponge's structure makes it virtually impossible to completely clean, so sponges must be discarded and replaced at least daily or after each use (according to the manufacturer's IFU).

Water Irrigation and Instrument Air Devices Water irrigation devices and instrument air devices should be checked to ensure they are in working order and have all of the necessary attachments. Adapter tips should be available to attach to different sized lumened devices. The adapter tips should be cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis and when visibly soiled. Care should be used to direct air and water spray away from employees.

What Is Instrument Air?

Instrument air is compressed air that has had dust, dirt and other pollutants removed. In healthcare, instrument air is used to power some medical devices such as pneumatic drills and saws. Instrument air is also used to dry medical devices after cleaning and decontamination. To qualify as instrument air, air must be free of oil, water, hydrocarbons and other contaminates that could cause infection.

Automatic Dosing Units and irrigators

Dosing units are used to deliver a specific and consistent amount of detergent to water to produce the cleaning solution. Dosing units deliver the precise dose of cleaning chemistries required for manual cleaning. Some types of dosing units also have irrigation capabilities to mechanically irrigate lumened devices. These units and their tubing, should be cleaned and disinfected per the IFU. The unit should be routinely verified for correct dosing and undergo calibration.

Floor Drains and Spray Nozzles

Many decontamination areas are equipped with a spray nozzle and floor drain or grate that provides drainage when manually cleaning bulkier items that do not fit into the cleaning sinks. The spray nozzle system is also used for cleaning the wheels of mobile equipment that cannot be sent through an automatic process.

Additional Tools

Specific instruments may require certain tools to perform cleaning and decontamination. For example, flexible endoscopes may require leak testing devices. Specific cleaning tools should be purchased at the same time as the instruments and replaced as necessary. All SP technicians assigned to the decontamination area should be trained on the proper use of special cleaning tools.

MECHANICAL CLEANERS

Several mechanical options are available to assist with decontamination. Mechanical cleaning facilitates the decontamination process by removing soil and microorganisms using an automated cleaning process. When functioning correctly, these machines operate consistently and reduce time and labor. The cycles on mechanical cleaners should not be shortened as a cleaning failure can result.

**Note:** The use of mechanical cleaners does not completely remove the need for manual cleaning.

Some units reduce microbial contamination through a multi­ step approach using a combination of cleaning solutions, hot water, rinsing, lubrication and drying; others provide only a cleaning function. Mechanical devices commonly found in the decontamination area include ultrasonic cleaners, irrigating sonics, washer-disinfectors, cart washers, and pasteurizers. SP technicians should not use any type of mechanical equipment without receiving proper training and a competency review.

**This section provides an overview of common equipment found in the decontamination area.**

Ultrasonic Cleaners

Most ultrasonic sonic cleaners are used for fine cleaning, not for disinfection or sterilization. They are used to remove soil from joints, crevices, lumens and other areas that are difficult to clean by other methods.

Ultra means beyond and sonic means sound. When an ultrasonic wave passes through a liquid, it makes the liquid vibrate. The vibrations are transmitted through the detergent bath and create **cavitation.**

The molecules of the solution are set in rapid motion and small gas bubbles develop. As the bubbles grow larger, they become unstable until they collapse or implode. This implosion creates a vacuum in the solution that draws minute bits of foreign matter including microorganisms from cracks and crevices, such as hinges and serrations on instruments. This vacuum action results in cleaning of hard to reach areas.

-   **Cavitation, is** The process used by an ultrasonic cleaner in which low pressure bubbles collapse or implode and dislodge soil from instruments.

After cavitation, rinsing is necessary to remove any residue, including detergents that remain on the instruments. It is important to routinely clean the tank according to the manufacturer's instructions.

An ultrasonic unit may have one, two or three chambers. When using a single-chamber unit, it is necessary to know whether the rinsing function is automatic. If the unit does not have a rinse cycle, it is important to manually rinse instruments after removing them from the sonic cleaner. Listed below are the different types of ultrasonic cleaners that may be in an SPD.

-   **Basic ultrasonic cleaners.** This basic ultrasonic cleaner is the simplest design, consisting of one or more chambers. Some models have automated processes consisting of several phases: filling with water, adding a cleaning agent, degassing, rinsing and draining. Simpler models are completely manual, with the user performing all the functions of filling, rinsing and draining.
-   **Ultrasonic irrigators.** This type of ultrasonic cleaner is designed to clean devices with lumens, flushing the inside of instruments as well as exterior surfaces. The cavitation process is used along with the addition of flushing and irrigation to remove bioburden from lumens, channels, box locks, and other crevices. These types of ultrasonic cleaners contain water ports with hoses and special adapters to connect to various devices such as laparoscopic, robotic and other instrumentation.
-   **Ultrasonic irrigator cleaner. Are** ultrasonics that have enhanced cleaning capabilities, which allows them to clean external surfaces and interior lumen channels using rapid flow, high pressure irrigation. This equipment provides programmable cleaning cycles.
-   **Ultrasonic irrigator cleaner disinfectors, is a Sonic cleaner capable of**  Cleaning internal lumens and channels through high pressure irrigation, detergent solution washing and even has an optional for lubrication and thermal disinfection.

Solution temperatures for cleaning instruments should be between 80 degrees Fahrenheit and109 degrees Fahrenheit, unless otherwise specified by the equipment or detergent manufacturer. Temperatures above 140 degrees Fahrenheit will coagulate protein, making it more difficult to remove. Water should be changed when it is visually soiled and at regularly scheduled intervals to prevent soiled particles from redepositing on instruments. The unit's tank should be cleaned, and the drain should be checked for debris per IFU.

How to De-Gas an Ultrasonic Cleaner

Water must be degassed each time it is changed in the sonic cleaner. Excess bubbles in the water are formed during filling, and these gas bubbles reduce the energy released during implosion. To de-gas a unit, fill the sonic cleaner, close the lid and run it for five to 10 minutes.

Degassing should only be done after the tank is filled and not while it is being filled, to avoid damaging the equipment. Some ultrasonic cleaners will automatically de-gas the solution when the chamber is filled. The lid of the sonic cleaner should be closed at all times when the unit is operating to prevent aerosols from being dispersed.

**When using ultrasonic cleaners, there are some important factors to remember, including the following:**

-   Instruments must be pre-cleaned prior to placing them in a sonic cleaner
-   When using ultrasonic cleaners, it is important to use the correct amount of low-foaming detergent
-   Instruments should be placed in trays designed for use in ultrasonic cleaners and for each specific model. Some ultrasonic models may require specific types of trays
-   All lumens must be completely filled with the cleaning solution, so the cavitation process can be effective inside the lumen
-   All instruments must be completely submerged in the solution, so they are exposed to the cavitation process
-   Hinged instruments placed in the sonic cleaner should be opened
-   Trays must not be overloaded. Check the ultrasonic IFU for load limitations
-   Lumened instruments should be connected to flushing ports by tubing and adapters
-   Heavy items should be placed on the bottom of the tray to prevent damage

Ultrasonic energy can loosen the tiny screws of delicate instruments and degrade the sealants in other devices.

**Items that should not be placed in a sonic cleaner include:**

-   Chrome plated and ebonized instruments and those made of plastic, cork, glass, wood, chrome and/or rubber Silicone mats
-   Instruments that contain fiber optic components

Stainless steel instruments should not be mixed with aluminum, brass or copper instruments in a sonic cycle. Placing instruments made of dissimilar metals in the ultrasonic cleaner can cause the transfer of ions from one instrument to another also known as **electroplating,** and can result in etching and pitting of the instrument. Damage to the finish of the instrument can create surface imperfections that may harbor microorganisms and debris. Users should also be aware that some sonic detergents may change or dull the color of anodized aluminum.

As with all processing equipment, the sonic cleaning equipment manufacturer's operating and maintenance recommendations should always be carefully followed.

-   **Electroplating, is** A process that uses electrical current in a solution to produce a metallic coating.

Detergents for Ultrasonic Cleaners

Only detergents that have been specially formulated for ultrasonic cleaners should be used. Detergents must be low foaming to prevent interference with the cleaning process.

Washer-Disinfectors

**Washer-disinfectors**: (washers) have been used for many years in SPDs and they are effective for cleaning instrumentation, instrument containers and utensils. Most are designed to perform multiple cleaning functions automatically.

Note: Automated mechanical washers are not appropriate for washing electrical, battery-powered or pneumatic devices unless otherwise stated in the device's IFU.

Washers work on the principle of **impingement** and are an effective means for cleaning and disinfecting instruments because of their spray force.

-   **Impingement, is** The spray force action of pressurized water against instruments being processed to physically remove bioburden.

In some ways, impingement washers work like a dishwasher; they rely on a combination of water temperature, special detergent and a spray-force action to remove soil from devices being processed. To clean effectively, items must be prepared properly and positioned in a manner that facilitates the mechanical cleaning process.

Mechanical washer-disinfectors may be a single-chamber model or an indexed model. In single-chamber models, all cleaning functions are performed in one chamber, whereas the index model moves the instrument trays into separate chambers for each function. Many washer models have multiple types of cycles, including gentle, orthopedic instrument and glass, as well as the regular instrument cycle.

Washers are only effective when used and serviced according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Operator manuals and detailed instructions about the basic operation and loading of instrument racks should be provided, and SP technicians must understand and comply with these instructions. Cycles should never be shortened. Important factors to remember when using a washer-disinfectors:

All disposable items, such as chemical indicators and filters, must be removed because they can clog the washer, preventing full cleaning action.

Silicone and rubber mats should be removed from sets to permit full impingement action.

Washer racks should never be overloaded, and spray arms should move freely during operation. Instruments that are sticking up and/or out of their perforated baskets must be relocated away from the spray arms.

Instruments should be disassembled, and their small parts should be placed inside an approved containment device for processing in the washer.

Hinged instruments should be opened to permit direct contact with the water and detergent.

Trays or sets with multiple levels should be opened, and each tray should be placed separately on the washer's rack. Failure to separate multi-level trays can cause the wash process to fail because tray layers impede contact between the spray action and the items within the tray.

Trays with lids or covers should be opened, so contents may be exposed to the washer spray.

Delicate instruments may be dislodged from the racks due to the blunt force of the spray action. These instruments should be confined in approved small, perforated baskets with approved lids.

Use hold-down screens or other retaining systems to prevent instruments from shifting.

Concave items, such as basins, should be placed so the spray can reach all surfaces and the water can easily drain.

**Connect lumens to lumen irrigator ports, if available.**

Instrument washer racks and conveyor systems should be inspected daily. Routine cleaning of washers should include inspection and cleaning of spray arms and washer jets. Mineral buildup will hinder spray action and disrupt cleaning efficacy. Washer traps/screens need special attention and should be inspected for debris at least daily and cleared of any obstructions.

Washer detergent levels should be monitored frequently. If detergent drums are allowed to run dry, a column of air may enter the detergent feed lines and affect the delivery of replacement detergent.

It is important to keep the chamber walls clean so the washer can perform at maximum efficiency. If white scale is seen in the chamber, it should be removed immediately with an approved descaler because scale can fall on instruments and clog pumps, motors and spray arms.

Automated washers have preset, factory-installed cycles for use in different cleaning situations. Instrument cycles generally are the longest cycle because they have multiple rinse, wash, lubrication and drying times to meet the instruments' cleaning needs. Basins and containers are commonly run on a utensil cycle.

Some washer manufacturers offer special cycles for delicate instruments. When running a mixed load of containers and instruments, the instrument cycle should be utilized for maximum cleaning. SP technicians should be familiar with different washer cycles and able to select the appropriate cleaning cycle for the items to be processed.

Some washer racks (manifolds) are equipped with irrigation lines that can be connected to certain complex instruments to add a channel flush to the mechanical cleaning process. Washer-disinfectors have a thermal disinfection cycle at the end of the cleaning /rinsing process.

-   **Thermal disinfection, is** Use of heat to reduce the amount of microorganisms excluding spores on a medical device.

Automated Cart Washers

Cart washers were originally designed to clean carts used for transport of various supplies and instruments. Some cart washers are designed to process rigid containers and other miscellaneous items; other models have validated instrument cycles designed to clean instrumentation. Several manufacturers offer cart washers with design features and special washer racks to facilitate the processing of some durable medical equipment.

Cart washers operate in a manner similar to automated instrument washers but on a larger scale. Spray arms deliver high-temperature water and detergent, and successive steps provide rinse waler and hot air-drying cycles. Cart washers resemble automated car washes in their cleaning process.

Most cart washers do not have multiple phase cycles like washer-disinfectors but include a high-temperature process to reduce bacteria and facilitate drying. Detergents selected for each washing should be formulated for use in cart washers.

**Important factors to remember when using a cart washer:**

-   When cleaning enclosed carts, ensure they are approved to be cleaned by a cart washer.
-   When opening cart doors, ensure they are secured in the open position.
-   Do not process instruments in a cart washer that is not designed for that purpose.
-   Do not process items inside carts. The walls of the cart will prevent cleaning solution and rinse water from reaching the items inside.

**Do not process items unless there are IFU.**

EQUIPMENT TESTING

ANSI, A A M I ST79 is a Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in health care facilities recommends a quality assurance program to ensure that the mechanical equipment is working properly. Commercially prepared products can be obtained to verify the cleaning effectiveness of the equipment.

If the mechanical cleaner has a printout, the printout should be reviewed and initialed after each cycle to ensure the cycle reached the expected parameters.

Mechanical cleaners can save time and labor, while producing a consistent process; however, it is important that SP technicians remember that human factors play a significant role in mechanical cleaning. In other words, mechanical cleaners are only as good as their operators.

CLEANING CHEMICALS AND LUBRICANTS

Many types of soil can be present on reusable devices. When soil, especially blood, is allowed to dry prior to cleaning, it becomes difficult to remove. Blood flows into instrument joints, hinges, grooves and other difficult-to-clean areas; it then coagulates and dries to create a significant challenge to cleaning. Soil adheres to microscopic irregularities in the surface of instruments and must be manually and mechanically scrubbed away or chemically treated; otherwise, the formation of biofilm can result.

Using proper chemicals in the correct concentrations rehydrates and loosens the soil and helps to properly clean the devices.

Each chemical used should be compatible with both the medical device and the cleaning equipment. Different types of chemicals are used in the cleaning process, including enzymatic products, detergents and presoaks (precleaning agents). Each has a specific purpose in efficiently processing reusable items.

Enzymatic Products

Enzymatic cleaners are biodegradable, nontoxic cleaning agents used to break down soils, stains and other debris on heavily soiled instruments. They are very helpful for processing difficult­ to-clean devices such as instruments with lumens. They are also used to keep instruments moist and begin breaking down the soil on instruments immediately after a procedure.

Enzymes are very specific in their action (for example, a protein enzyme will not affect fat/lipase molecules) and there are different types of enzymatic products available. Some can be used at the point of use to moisten and loosen soil on instruments, and others are used in manual or automatic washing processes.

**Popular enzymes used in SPDs include:**

-   **Protease, are** the enzymes that break down proteins, such as blood, mucous, feces and albumin
-   **Lipase, are the** enzymes that break down fat or fatty deposits, such as bone marrow
-   **Amylase, are the** enzymes that break down starch into sugars

Elements in soil can gradually degrade enzymes during use and reduce their cleaning efficacy. Soil that has dried on a device must be rehydrated before enzymes that facilitate its removal can be effective. Point-of-use treatment (keeping the instrument free of gross soil) can reduce these problems. After precleaning, the instrument should remain moist to keep soil from drying, and hydration should be maintained to optimize the enzyme's efficacy.

Many enzymatic products used in the decontamination process are single enzyme products, so it is important to know the type of soil being cleaned. Multi-enzymatic products contain more than one type of enzyme. Detergents take longer to clean if they are not used in conjunction with enzymatic products.

Monitoring for proper temperature is critical when dealing with enzyme-based products. Temperatures should not exceed 140° degrees Fahrenheit, unless otherwise stated by the enzyme manufacturer.

Detergents

Water is not an effective cleaning agent; therefore, detergents are used to enhance its cleaning ability. Detergents contain emulsifiers, surfactants and chelating agents to increase their cleaning efficacy. Chelating agents have an ionic charge that allows soils with the opposite charge to break away and attach to the chelating agent. An emulsifier surrounds these particles to prevent them from reattaching and they also help break bonds that oils can create to trap soil.

-   **Emulsifiers: are** Any ingredient used to bind together substances that typically do not combine such as oil and water.
-   **Surfactants: are** substances that lowers the surface tension of the water and increases the solubility of organic compounds.
-   **Chelating agents:** are Chemicals that hold hard water minerals in solution and prevent soap or detergent from reacting with the minerals.

When used properly, detergents penetrate and remove soil from instruments and keep soil in suspension so it does not reattach to the instrument. Remember that detergents do not kill microorganisms (unless they contain a biocide). Instead, they help to clean the instrument by removing bacteria-laden soil.

Detergents are designed to perform specific tasks. In the home setting, there are different detergents for washing dishes, doing laundry, and cleaning floors. In a similar manner, detergents for decontamination in the healthcare facility are formulated for different applications.

Some detergents work in hard water, some are low-foaming varieties that do not hinder the operation of the mechanical cleaning equipment, and others are developed specifically for a certain type of equipment, like those formulated for ultrasonic cleaners.

Detergents also come in several forms. Liquid detergents can be purchased in small quantities for use at a sink or in large quantities for use in mechanical washers.

Detergents are selected at each facility, based on the items' and facility's specific cleaning needs, the quality of the water, and the types of soil present. Several types of detergents can be used for cleaning surgical instruments. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to know how each type of detergent functions and how to properly use different detergents.

**Neutral detergents:** are the most commonly used type in the U.S. Neutral detergents have a pH value of 6 to 8.

-   **Advantages:** Neutral pH detergents are effective on organic and inorganic soils and are safe to use on aluminum products.
-   **Disadvantages:** Neutral pH detergents are not very effective in hard water they produce more foam and are more difficult to rinse than other types of detergents.

**Alkaline detergents:** are highly effective at removing organic soils such as blood, fats and oils. Alkaline detergents range in pH from 8 to more than 14. Prior to using an alkaline detergent, refer to the medical device and equipment manufacturer's IFU.

-   **Advantages:** Alkaline detergents remove a wider range of soil than any other type of detergent.
-   **Disadvantages:** Alkaline detergents require thorough rinsing because they can leave a powdery residue on the instrument's surface. Alkaline detergents cannot be used on devices made of bronze, copper or aluminum.

**Acid detergents:** are primarily used to remove mineral deposits such as hard water, urine, minerals and scale. Acid detergents have a pH of 1.6 to 3.

-   **Advantages:** Acid detergents are excellent for removing mineral deposits and urine. They work well on inorganic soils, neutralize alkaline residues and make stainless steel shine.
-   **Disadvantages:** Acid detergents can damage the surfaces of stainless steel and aluminum, bronze and glass. Disposal into drains and sewer lines may be restricted in some states.

Review of Common Chemicals Used in the Decontamination Area

During the course of any shift, SP technicians must select and properly use several different chemicals. While initial selection of chemicals to be used in the department is done by managers, the technician must select the proper chemical for the job from the chemicals available in the decontamination area.

**Note:** Each chemical is different and cannot be substituted for another. Technicians must read labels carefully and ask questions if any information is not understood.

**The following is a review of chemicals commonly found in the decontamination area:**

Precleaning chemicals are used in the first step in the decontamination process. Some commonly used precleaning agents include detergent solutions, enzymatic detergents and combination enzyme-germicide detergents.

Precleaning should begin immediately after completion of any invasive procedure. Blood and other visible debris, if left on an instrument, serve as a reservoir for microbial growth and may damage an instrument's finish. If not removed, the corrosive agents in blood and body tissue can penetrate the protective outer layer of an instrument and cause rusting or pitting of the stainless steel.

The manufacturer's instructions must be followed when using these precleaning products. Exceeding the time allowed for the instruments to be immersed in the solution can damage and corrode instruments and shortening the immersion time from what the instructions recommend can cause precleaning products to be ineffective.

Precleaning chemicals are applied at the point of use, but they may also be used in the decontamination area to keep soil moist and loosen dried soil. They must be removed prior to the cleaning process.

Manual cleaning chemicals, when mixed properly, penetrate under the soil and break the bond that attaches the soil to the instruments. These cleaning products' main function is to remove soil, not kill microorganisms. Low-foaming and free­ rinsing manual cleaners should be used. The manufacturer's IFU should be followed for proper dilution and to determine the proper water temperature for their use. Manual cleaners are usually neutral or alkaline products.

-   **Mechanical cleaning chemicals:** are specially designed for use in mechanical cleaning processes. They are low foaming and designed to work with the specific mechanical cleaning equipment such as ultrasonic cleaners, careful attention must be paid to the manufacturer's IFU.
-   **Descalers:** are not typically required if the water quality and detergent mixtures are correct and the equipment is operating properly. However problems can go unnoticed until a chalky, powdery, hard to remove substance appears in equipment and sinks.

    When this occurs, an acidic detergent or descaler is needed to remove the scale. It is important to use a descaling product when scale is detected in the cleaning equipment because scale can interfere with the equipment's cleaning ability.

-   **Lubricants**, are often called instrument milk, because of their milky appearance, are an important part of the instrument maintenance program because they help maintain the integrity of instruments and keep them in good working order. Instruments require different types of lubricant depending on the design of the device or the sterilization method.
-   **Lubrication,** Should be performed after cleaning, as one of the final steps in the mechanical wash process, or it can be applied manually in the clean assembly area using a spray bottle. In the past, instrument baths (pans filled with instrument lubricating solution) were commonly used. This process is now discouraged because of the increased risk of contamination.

SP technicians must always use lubrication according to the manufacturer's instructions to ensure proper contact time and dilution. It is also important to ensure the lubricant is designed for use with the instruments to be cleaned and compatible with the specific sterilization process that will follow.

**Stain and rust removers** are used when the normal cleaning process does not remove stains on an instrument. Stains and rust typically result from improper care such as soaking the instruments in saline. Stain and rust remover can be used after instrument cleaning to restore the luster to stainless steel instruments.

These chemicals remove hard water deposits, rust scale and discoloration from instrumentation and processing equipment. Most stain and rust removers are acid based compounds of 0 to 6.9 pH that react with minerals and iron on the instruments. They remove mineral and detergent buildup, leaving the surfaces bright and shiny, and the instruments moving freely.

Because these chemicals are acid-based, the IFU must be carefully followed to prevent instrument damage. After using a stain remover, the instruments should be recleaned.

When using any cleaning chemical, temperature is an important factor. Most cleaning chemicals deactivate if the temperature is higher than l80° degrees Fahrenheit. Unless specified by the manufacturer, cleaning chemicals should never be combined with other chemicals.

**To prevent instrument damage, the following chemicals should not be used to clean instruments unless recommended by the device manufacturer:**

-   Abrasive cleaning compounds
-   Saline
-   Buffered iodine such as povidone iodine or betadine
-   Hydrogen peroxide
-   Bleach

**Any chemical not specifically recommended by the medical device manufacturer**

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Knowing and following the manufacturer’s IFU are critical components of the decontamination process. Medical device IFU have undergone a scientific validation that provides the specific steps that must be taken to decontaminate each device. IFU are provided with every newly purchased item. The SPD should have a copy of all IFU, either as a paper or digital copy.

SP technicians must understand how to follow each medical device's IFU and also clearly understand the IFU for any equipment and chemical they use. Failure to follow IFU can result in a failed decontamination process and damage to instruments and equipment.

STEPS IN THE DECONTAMINATION PROCESS

**Point-of-Use Treatment**

The process of decontamination begins with the encl user, at the point of use. OR staff should take the time to ensure that the required point-of-use treatment process is performed. Following point-of-use treatment, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation A A M I and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses A O R N, recommend that instrument users take time to properly prepare instrumentation for transport to the decontamination area.

**Soiled Receiving**

If soiled items are hand-delivered to the decontamination area, the person delivering the items should place them on a cart or countertop designated for receipt of items into the decontamination area.

When carts loaded with soiled items are received, proper body mechanics must be used when handling the heavy carts. When loading and unloading carts from dumbwaiters or elevators, the weight of the cart should be checked. It is also critical to ensure that the wheels are aligned and that they will roll over door spaces or uneven edges. If the cart is too heavy to move easily, some items should be removed to lighten the load.

If items are in a closed cart or transport container, the lid or doors must be carefully opened because items may have shifted during transport. Items should be removed from the cart or container carefully and placed on a flat surface near a sink.

**The following guidelines should be followed during the unloading process:**

-   **Fluids** should be disposed of or contained at the point of use. If transported, fluids should be in a leak-proof container. Dispose of any fluids, per facility policy.

If possible, disposable items and reusable textiles should be removed at the point of use. If this is not feasible, the items should be bagged and sent to the decontamination area. They should not be transported unless contained.

Reusable sharps, including scissors and chisels, should be separated and safely contained at the point of use.

-   **Disposable sharps**, such as scalpel blades and trocars, should be removed and discarded at the point of use. If disposable sharps are found in the transport device or in any tray, they should be removed and discarded in an approved sharps container. Misplaced sharps should be reported to the immediate supervisor per the hospital policy.

**Note:** Every sharps injury should be reported in accordance with facility policy and protocols.

Items for third-party preprocessors should be placed into their specific container. These disposable items will be sent out of the facility for reprocessing by a company that has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the FDA, for this type of reprocessing. Examples of these types of items include pulse oximeter sensors, deep vein thrombosis or DVT sleeves, and laparoscopic instruments.

Carefully remove all tray liners, indicators, filters, tip protectors and other disposable items left inside instrument trays.

Remove the filter retention plates from rigid containers. Containers and lids should be cleaned without the retention plate or reusable filter in place. Discard disposable filters and clean reusable filters per the manufacturer's instructions.

If the container system has valve type closures, the valves should be inspected and cleaned following the manufacturer's instructions. Improper cleaning of container valves can

prevent the sterilant from reaching the instruments and may also lead to contamination of the instruments after sterilization.

Interior baskets should be removed from inside the container. Instruments may be mechanically cleaned inside the interior tray after manual preparation.

Ensure the transport container or the case cart is completely empty, then clean per the manufacturer's IFU.

Cleaning

Cleaning instruments and other medical devices is the primary function of the decontamination area. It is obvious that instruments should be cleaned after use; however, there are also other times when instruments should be cleaned.

Thorough cleaning and adherence to IFU is important because cleaning process failures put patients and staff at risk. There are several types of cleaning methods:

-   Precleaning, this process should occur at the point of use
-   Manual cleaning, also known as cleaning by hand
-   Mechanical cleaning, cleaning items using specialized cleaning equipment
-   No matter what method of cleaning is selected, it should always follow the device manufacturer's IFU

Precleaning

Instruments must be precleaned to remove gross soil, such as blood and tissue debris, prior to mechanical cleaning. Gross debris must be removed from instruments undergoing mechanical cleaning; otherwise, it will circulate through the washer and be deposited onto the other instruments, which will block the cleaning action. For washing to be effective, all surfaces of the device should have contact with the cleaning solutions.

Precleaning solutions can interfere with the following cleaning steps, therefore all presoak chemicals must be completely removed before moving instruments to mechanical cleaning cycles. This can be accomplished either manually or mechanically.

Manual Cleaning

Manual cleaning is done to remove soil that was not removed or was only softened during the precleaning process; this is achieved by the use of friction and specialized cleaning chemicals.

**Manual cleaning may be performed:**

-   Before the item is mechanically cleaned to ensure precleaning chemicals, blood, protein and other soil is removed
-   When the decontamination area does not have a mechanical method of cleaning
-   To clean items that cannot be immersed in water
-   For instruments with lumens
-   For delicate or complex medical devices such as microsurgical and robotic instruments
-   For all items that require manual cleaning as part of their IFU

Manual Preparation and Cleaning Processes

The work area should be set up to accommodate the type of items to be cleaned. For example, for instruments that can be immersed, the sink should be filled with the appropriate cleaning solution. Each instrument set should be cleaned in a fresh cleaning solution. Place heavier instruments in the sink first, followed by lighter, more delicate items. Items should be placed gently into the sink. SP technicians should not "dump" them into the sink because instruments can damage easily.

Items should be placed in the sink in the following manner:

-   Hinged instruments should be fully opened when placed in the sink.
-   Multi-part instruments should be disassembled per manufacturer's instructions so all parts of the instrument can be exposed to the cleaning solution. Keep all parts near each other during the cleaning process.
-   Lumen or cannulated items should be fully submerged, then flushed with fresh cleaning solution; this will force air bubbles out of the lumen and ensure all the inner surfaces are in contact with the cleaning solution. If available, placing lumened items in a vertical soaking cylinder also helps ensure air bubbles are not inside the lumens.
-   Ensure detergent can reach every part of the device being cleaned. If the detergent cannot reach every part of the instrument, the instrument cannot be thoroughly cleaned. Some IFU specify the amount of time an item must be soaked.

Items that cannot be immersed, like power equipment and many cables and cords, should be set aside and processed separately. Many SPDs have a sink area designated for cleaning these non­ immersible items.

All instrument surfaces and cleaning efforts must be focused and performed consistently. Instruments should be brushed in a to-and-fro motion under the water's surface. Brushing under the water's surface prevents aerosolization. Aerosolization occurs when ultramicroscopic particles are released into the air.

This is a concern because the cleaning solution contains contaminates from the instruments being cleaned. When cleaning, pay special attention to hinges and the tips of the instruments because these areas harbor the most soil. All serrated, toothed and creviced areas should be brushed to ensure the instrument is properly cleaned.

Lumened instruments should be cleaned carefully with a brush after soaking in the cleaning solution. Select a brush that fits into the lumen and touches all inner surfaces. With the lumened instrument under the surface of the water, gently push the brush through the lumen several times. As the brush comes out of the lumened device, it should be examined for debris and cleaned, and then pulled through the lumen to further clean the lumen.

Brushing should continue until the debris is removed and no longer seen during examination. The lumen should be checked for cleanliness by using a clean brush or an approved, non-linting pipe-cleaner-type product or a borescope.

Because curettes, Kerrison and other rongeurs, and other orthopedic instruments can conceal bone and other bioburden, removing material with bristle brushes should be an initial step in the cleaning process. All crevices should be checked carefully because blood and bone may be in other areas of the instrument, not just the biting or cutting section.

Instruments tagged for repair must still be cleaned and decontaminated. When instruments are returned from repair, they must be considered contaminated. Therefore, they must be cleaned, decontaminated and inspected before being returned to their respective sets.

Delicate instruments are a cleaning challenge; they must be separated from regular or heavy instruments during cleaning. Devices used for delicate surgical procedures are generally lightweight, with fine points and tips. Mixing them with heavy instruments or placing heavy devices on top of them can cause damage and misalignment.

Delicate instruments, such as skin hooks, can slip through perforated baskets and become entangled. Also, check the IFU to ensure the proper cleaning chemical is being used. Unless otherwise stated by the manufacturer, clean these instruments as one would other surgical instruments, but with more care in handling. Always check the IFU to determine whether the instrument can be mechanically processed after manual cleaning. If processing in a washer-disinfector, a delicate cycle will likely need to be selected.

Ophthalmic instruments have special cleaning protocols because of the increasing incidents of **toxic anterior segment syndrome or T A S S.** Most instances of T A S S, appear to be related to instrument processing; therefore, the Instrument Cleaning Guideline in A O R N's Guidelines for PeriOperative Practice recommends special precautions when processing intraocular ophthalmic instruments.

The procedures for processing ophthalmic instruments are different from general instrumentation, which includes cleaning intraocular instruments separately from general surgical instruments.

This separation can help prevent cross-contamination with bioburden from heavily soiled nonophthalmic surgical instruments. Manufacturer's cleaning instructions must be carefully followed. It is recommended that facilities have sufficient instrumentation to allow adequate time for processing between patients.

-   **Toxic anterior segment syndrome T A S S: is an** Acute postoperative inflammatory reaction in which a noninfectious substance enters the anterior segment of the eye and induces toxic damage to the intraocular tissues.

There are thousands of instruments on the market and cleaning each one requires specific knowledge. Instruments that are designed to perform the same functions but are made by different manufacturers may need different cleaning processes. Consult the medical device manufacturer for special considerations and to determine whether these devices can withstand automated washers.

Orthopedic and neurologic surgeries have many instrument sets that require extended preparation and inspection prior to and during cleaning. Joint replacement cutting guides, rasps, reamers and broaches hide gross amounts of blood, bone and tissue.

This can occur even with the best point-of-use treatment in the OR, and these instruments must be cleaned with brushes and extensive hand detailing. Presoaking with enzymatic detergents can help remove much of the bioburden from crevices. Some washer manufacturers have designed special washer racks to hold and flush out these devices.

-   **Implants**, such as orthopedic screws and plates, are not compatible with lubrication. When processing implants, use cycles that exclude the use of lubrication.
-   **Laparoscopic and robotic instrumentation:** can be difficult and time consuming to clean. Instrument manufacturers provide extensive cleaning instructions that must be carefully followed to ensure the instruments are clean. Always use properly sized brushes in the lumened areas and carefully follow any flushing instructions provided by the manufacturer.

For example, these instruments, especially robotic instruments, can be damaged if too much air and water pressure are used. Some types of mechanical cleaning equipment have special baskets, manifolds or connections to flush these items during mechanical cleaning. These items must still be manually cleaned and flushed, even when using a mechanical method.

Flexible and rigid endoscopes also pose special cleaning concerns. IFU for each specific model must be carefully followed.

TASS Precautions in the Decontamination Area

**T A S S:** usually occurs when contaminants enter the eye during eye surgery. Those contaminants can be the result of inadequate instrument processing. The risk of T A S S can be reduced in the decontamination area by:

-   Carefully following all manufacturers IFU for cleaning
-   Taking actions to prevent the formation of biofilm on instruments
-   Using only enzymes and detergents recommended by the manufacturer
-   Keeping cleaning tools, such as brushes and syringes, clean
-   Flushing lumens
-   Rinsing with copious amounts of the recommended rinse water
-   Avoiding the use of lubrication
-   Cleaning in a designated cleaning area, separately from general surgical instrument

New, repaired or loaned instruments received in the SPD must be cleaned prior to disinfection or sterilization. Although these instruments may look clean, their surfaces are covered in fine metal dust, oils and other debris from the manufacturing and repair processes. These instruments have also been handled and exposed to outside elements during shipping.

Instruments from back-up stock should be cleaned prior to use because they have been hanging on walls or stored in drawers for some time. These instruments could have been handled multiple times and most likely contain dust and other environmental contaminants.

Cleaning Instruments That Cannot Be Immersed

Instruments, such as power equipment and cameras, cannot be immersed in water. The device manufacturer's IFU should be reviewed to ensure that proper cleaning chemistries and cleaning methods are used.

-   **Hoses and cords,** should be carefully wiped down using the approved solution and a clean, soft, non-linting cloth. Special care should be taken at the ends of the hoses and cords because water will damage these items.

Many of these types of instruments are a dark color, which makes it difficult to see dried blood; therefore, meticulous attention must be paid when cleaning these items. Unless approved by the manufacturer, do not rinse these items under running water. Carefully check these items to ensure there are no nicks, breaks or tears in the outer cover. If any damage is noted, mark the item for repair prior to sending it to the assembly area.

-   **Power equipment:** presents challenges to SP technicians. These devices are powered by batteries, pneumatic air, or electricity. Care should be taken to prevent exposure of the connection points and battery contacts to moisture or chemicals. These connection areas can react with chemicals and cause damage and loss of electrical contact with the power source. The use of a battery, hose or cable designated for the decontamination area will help keep these connections dry.
-   **Cannulated drills:** may have their lumens cleaned with running tap water, if approved by the manufacturer, and they should be brushed with a soft brush. A plastic syringe filled with water and enzymatic detergent can assist in delivering cleaning agents to hard-to-reach areas. If the instrument cannot be cleaned under running water, use a clean, soft cloth, appropriately sized brushes, and syringes filled with cleaning and rinsing solutions.

Frequently, orthopedic saws have residual bone chips and impacted bioburden in their working parts. They must be Flushed and brushed clean under running water, if approved by the manufacturer.

Power accessories, such as chucks, can usually be immersed in the cleaning solution; however, some may need to be hand processed without immersion. Drill and saw attachments usually need non­ immersion cleaning; consult and follow the manufacturer's IFU for the proper cleaning method.

Cleaning Instrument Containers and Basins

Cleaning rigid instrument containers and basins requires procedures that differ from those used for instruments. A neutral­ pH detergent is typically recommended because acidic or alkaline pH detergents will damage aluminum and some composite materials. If processing manually, carefully clean all surface areas while the item is immersed in the cleaning solution, then rinse. If cleaning these items mechanically, place on the appropriate rack or manifold.

When cleaning containers, the filter retention plate should be removed and not processed attached to the container or lid. Handles, locking mechanisms and container rims should be inspected for cracks and missing components. If basins are dented or bent or if containers are damaged, they should be marked for repair or removal from service prior to sending them to the assembly area.

Inspection

SP technicians play one of the most important roles in the next step of the decontamination process: inspection. Inspection is a crucial step in the process because it helps ensure the safety of the devices as well as employees and the patient. Each item cleaned must be carefully inspected for visible debris. If debris is detected, the item should be re-cleaned according to the manufacturer's IFU.

Quality Testing Cleaning Verification

Throughout cleaning is the foundation for disinfection and sterilization. Cleaning verification methods help demonstrate that the cleaning process is effective and are used for individual instrumentation and cleaning equipment.

Several devices, including lighted magnification, borescopes and cleaning verification tests, are available to inspect instruments for cleanliness.

Decontamination

The decontamination process involves the use of physical or chemical procedures to remove, inactivate or destroy bloodborne pathogens on an item's surface. The purpose of decontamination is to make devices safe for people who are not wearing gloves and to reduce the bioburden to make the next processing steps easier. Some instruments are safe for handling after they have been thoroughly cleaned; however, others require exposure to a microbiocidal process.

CONCLUSION

Cleaning is a complex, multi-step process. The success of disinfection and sterilization processes depends on a successful cleaning process. SP technicians must understand the cleaning process for each medical device and perform it consistently to help ensure the safety of patients, visitors and healthcare personnel.
