**INTRODUCTION**

Most medical procedures require the use of supplies, instruments and/or equipment. Some items are used once and then discarded, while others are reused multiple times. Reusable items must be thoroughly cleaned, inspected, disinfected and/ or sterilized before they can be used to treat other patients. The Sterile Processing department (SPD) in a healthcare facility performs these important reprocessing activities.

**Advancing Technologies**

Medical technology is rapidly advancing. The medical devices used in the Operating Room (OR) and throughout the healthcare facility have changed dramatically over the years. As these devices become more complex, the same can be said of the methods required to reprocess them.

Like the entire medical field, the Sterile Processing (SP) profession has evolved significantly. Advances experienced in patient treatment and care have come with advances in the medical devices used to provide those services. Today's increasingly sophisticated medical devices require more complex handling and processing, which has resulted in many changes for SP technicians. These changes have not happened overnight but have been introduced steadily throughout the past years.

For example, one need only to look back a short time to identify changes that have enabled increases in **minimally invasive surgery (MIS).** These procedures provide many benefits to patients, including shortened hospital stays, smaller incisions, reduced trauma and shorter recovery times. These procedures require complex instrumentation, which requires complex processing protocols.

Medical technologies will continue to advance, devices will become more complex and SP technicians will be required to keep up with advances. "01is chapter will introduce the field of SP and provide an overview of the knowledge and skills required to meet the demand for timely, safe and functional medical devices.

**Minimally invasive surgery (MIS):** A surgical procedure performed in a manner that causes little or no trauma or injury to the patient; it is often performed through a cannula using lasers, endoscopes or laparoscopes. Compared with other procedures, minimally invasive procedures involve smaller incisions, less tissue damage and bleeding, smaller amounts of anesthesia, less pain and minimal scarring.

What's in a Name?

Central Processing, Sterile Processing, Surgical Supply and Processing

SPD goes by many names. No matter the name, the department supports caregiver departments by processing reusable medical devices. Many SPDs dispense sterile supplies for performing patient procedures and some departments also provide medical equipment for patient use.

This vital department is an important part of the facility's infection prevention and quality processes throughout many patient care areas.

STERILE PROCESSING WORKFLOW

The SPD is the central location for the delivery of soiled (used) medical devices and the distribution of clean and sterile items. To provide a safe working environment, facilities should implement processes and procedures with specific workflows for medical devices to help ensure safety. Soiled materials must be isolated from their clean counterparts to ensure acceptable processing conditions. A one-way flow of materials from the soiled area to the clean processing area and on to the sterile storage area is required.

To facilitate one-way flow of goods and maintain distinction between soiled and clean work areas, physical barriers or walls are used to separate the functional areas of the SPD. These areas include decontamination, preparation and packaging (prep and pack), sterilization and sterile storage/distribution.

**Decontamination**

**Decontamination** is the physical or chemical process that renders an inanimate object-such as a medical device that may be contaminated with harmful microbes-safe for further handling. The decontamination area is where all soiled instruments from the OR are received, along with other items such as medical equipment. Instrumentation and medical equipment can be collected from different places within the healthcare facility, e.g., Labor and Delivery (L&D), the Emergency Department (ED) and patient care units like the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

When medical devices are received, they must be properly sorted, disassembled and **cleaned** using established protocols.  All items returned to the decontamination area are considered contaminated and potentially infectious.

Decontamination is an important process because items cannot be considered sterile or high-level disinfected if they are not effectively cleaned; therefore, cleaning is the first step in the sterilization process. An effective cleaning process may be accomplished with manual and/or mechanical cleaning techniques. SP technicians must have an in-depth knowledge of the items to be cleaned in this area and must select the appropriate method of decontamination as recommended by the device manufacturer. After thorough cleaning, many items in the decontamination area will be sent to the preparation and packaging area for further processing.

-   **Decontamination:** To make safe by removing or reducing contamination by infectious organisms or other harmful substances to an acceptable level.
-   **Cleaning:** The removal of all visible and non- visible soil and any other foreign material from medical devices being processed.

Working in the decontamination area requires a thorough knowledge and understanding of microbiology and the decontamination process. SP staff must be able to identify and clean a wide variety of medical devices. Knowledge about cleaning and disinfecting agents and their use is critical. Protocols for waste disposal, transportation of contaminated items and operation of equipment used in the cleaning process, including washer-disinfectors, ultrasonic cleaners, cart washers, steam guns and specialty washers, is required.

SP technicians working in the decontamination area must be protected from the environment. The physical layout of this area, as well as cleaning equipment used in it, must meet the appropriate standards of governmental agencies and the recommendations of professional organizations. Policies and procedures must be developed and followed to ensure that work practices minimize employee injury and exposure to pathogens. To meet the facility's and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) safety requirements, SP technicians must wear special attire, called **personal protective equipment (PPE).** PPE minimizes exposure to bloodborne pathogens and other contaminants. PPE includes a fluid-resistant facemask, eye protection, a fluid-resistant cover gown, general purpose utility gloves and fluid-resistant shoe covers.

-   **Personal protective equipment (PPE):** A part of Standard Precautions for all healthcare workers to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure when in contact with blood and body fluids of any patient. PPE includes fluid-resistant protective clothing, disposable gloves, eye protection, face masks and shoe covers.

**Preparation and Packaging**

After items are safe for handling, they are delivered to the prep and pack area of the SPD. Each item should be carefully inspected for cleanliness, proper function and possible defects. Instruments and other devices should be inspected, packaged and labeled in preparation for sterilization.

SP technicians must be able to identify thousands of surgical instruments. They must understand how instruments are manufactured, how they are constructed, how to test them and how to best maintain them. It is essential that SP professionals have the knowledge and training to maintain instruments properly, consistently and safely.

Surgical specialty instruments, equipment and implants also require special knowledge and expertise. SP technicians must be able to select the proper packaging system and use proper techniques for packaging items for sterilization.

**Sterilization**

Items to be sterilized must be properly identified and the correct methods and parameters for **sterilization** must be followed according to the manufacturer's **instructions for use (IFU).** The principles necessary to achieve sterilization must be understood and applied. Sterilizers must be loaded and operated properly, and sterilization quality assurance measures must be followed to help ensure that sterilization parameters have been met. Records must be maintained, and SP technicians must be aware of factors that can compromise sterile packaging.

-   **Sterilization:** Process by which all forms of microbial life, including bacteria, viruses, spores and fungi, are completely destroyed.

Instructions for use (IFU**)** Information provided by a device manufacturer that provides detailed instructions on how to properly use and/or process the device.

Personnel working in the preparation, packaging and sterilization areas of SP must wear facility-required attire such as a scrub suit and hair coverings. It is essential that SP technicians diligently adhere to dress codes and safe work practices to protect the environment from contamination.

**Sterile Storage and Distribution**

The supply area of SP is dedicated to the storage of sterile instruments and clean or sterile supplies. A separate area for removing supplies from shipping cartons and containers should be provided. The major portion of the work in this area involves receiving, storing and dispensing supplies and sterile instruments.

While items may be dispensed to almost all departments within a healthcare facility, the major focus of this area is servicing the OR; this is usually accomplished using a **case cart system.** The bulk of surgical supplies may be stored in a central location (i.e., the SPD). A dependable system must be in place to supply items to surgery from the sterile storage area

Surgical procedures are usually scheduled through a surgery scheduling office using a special computer program. When surgical procedures are scheduled, authorized personnel assign a **Case-cart** or **Doctor's (Physician's) Preference Card** to each procedure. This generates a **Case-cart Pull Sheet (pick list)** that identifies items specific to the doctor and procedure.

SP technicians use this sheet to place supplies from the sterile storage area onto the case carts that transport these items to the appropriate OR/surgical suite. Personnel working in this area usually gather instruments and supplies needed for all scheduled surgical procedures during the day or evening before they will be used.

Other areas within the healthcare facility may be supplied from the sterile storage area. Also, facility personnel from different departments frequently require items that are only available from SP. Those working in the sterile storage area must be familiar with all supplies within the location in order to provide fast and accurate customer service.

Open lines of communication must be maintained between those in SP and sterile storage areas to help ensure that an adequate stock of sterile items is always available.

Also, the **Supply Chain Management** department, also known as the Materials Management department, is an important link in the supply process; therefore, effective communication and problem­ solving skills must be fostered between personnel in these two important departments.

-   **Case-Cart System:** an inventory control system for products/equipment typically used in an OR that involves use of an enclosed or covered cart (generally prepared for one surgical case and not used for general supply replenishment).
-   **Case cart:** A cart prepared for an individual procedure. Case carts usually contain all instruments, supplies and utensils needed for a specific procedure.
-   **Doctor's (physician's) preference card:** A document that identifies a physician's needs (requests and preferences) for a specific medical procedure. Preference cards usually contain information regarding the instruments, equipment, supplies and utensils used by a specific physician. They may also include reminders for the staff of the physician's preferences regarding patient draping, instruments and supplies.
-   **Case-cart pull sheet (pick list):** A list of specific supplies, utensils and instruments for a specific procedure. SP technicians use these lists to assemble the items needed for individual procedures.
-   **Supply Chain Management:** Department that procures and distributes resources and manages supplies, goods and services to providers and patients.

Personnel working in the sterile storage area must have thorough knowledge of every item, how it is used, where it is located, and the process for obtaining it.

**Other knowledge and skills include those needed for:**

**Inventory control and supply distribution**

-   Surgical specialties and procedures
-   Sterile storage and handling requirements
-   Computer systems relating to inventory and case carts
-   Acquisition and disposition of supplies
-   Resolution of supply problems

All SP areas must exercise careful environmental control conditions. Each work area should be restricted to assigned and authorized personnel who consistently follow the facility's dress code policies. Strict traffic control patterns must control the movement of people and goods through the department. Air pressure levels must be maintained to control air movements. Proper air pressure control helps to prevent the flow of bacteria­ laden particulates and dust from soiled to clean areas.

**Ancillary Areas and Equipment**

The SPD performs the primary medical device processing for the healthcare facility. Specialty procedure carts, such as isolation, urology and emergency carts, can be processed *by* the SPD.1l1ese specialty carts are cleaned, inventoried and restocked between patient use and may be stored in the SP area until needed. Other patient care equipment, such as IV pumps, can also be processed and stored in the department.

**Loaned Instruments**

Loaned instruments are brought in for a specific patient procedure, for evaluation of new technology or to use while existing devices are being repaired. There should be a designated location and processes for receiving processing, distribution, cleaning, and return.

**THE PROCESSING CYCLE**

Work performed in the SPD usually follows a processing cycle. After use, items that can be reprocessed are returned to the decontamination area to start the process all over again. It is important to note that at each step in the process, items are inspected to ensure that they are clean, in good repair, assembled, and processed correctly.

SP technicians must not only master specific skills in each work area, but they must also learn new ones as technologies, regulations, standards and best practices evolve.

**A Basic Educational Foundation Is Needed**

Numerous dimensions of knowledge and skills are required for SP technicians to be successful in their jobs. A basic educational foundation is necessary to form the base for more specialized knowledge and skills.

**Examples of these skills include the ability to:**

-   Read and write, including the use of reports, manuals and IFU
-   Communicate clearly with inter- and intra- departmental team members
-   Interpret technical materials used for SP practices and procedures
-   Understand concepts of microbial transmission and infection prevention
-   Understand and use surgical and medical terminology

**BASIC JOB KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS**

SP professionals require significant knowledge, and skill sets to perform effectively on the job. Knowledge and skill sets should include the following:

**Communication Skills**

SP technicians must know alternative methods of providing and obtaining information, they must be effective verbal and written communicators.

**To do so, they must be able to:**

-   Assess the ability of other people to understand what is being communicated
-   Adapt the communication style to individual needs
-   Apply active listening skills using reflection, restatement and clarification techniques
-   Interact appropriately and respectfully with diverse groups in numerous situations
-   Communicate in a manner that is straightforward, understandable, accurate and timely
-   Use facility-specific guidelines and methods to send and receive information
-   Access and use electronically produced information

**Facility Systems**

SP technicians must understand how their role fits into their department, their organization and the overall healthcare environment. They must be able to identify how key systems affect the services they perform and the quality of care they provide.

**To do so requires that they:**

-   Are aware of the range of services offered to customers
-   Prevent unnecessary waste and duplication
-   Participate in quality improvement activities
-   Use resources, including other staff members and training opportunities

**Employability Skills**

Successful SP technicians use employability skills to enhance their employment opportunities and job satisfaction, and they maintain and upgrade those skills as required.

**Examples include:**

-   Maintaining appropriate personal skills, such as attendance and time management, and assume individual responsibility for their actions
-   Maintaining professional conduct standards
-   Using analytical skills to solve problems and make decisions
-   Formulating solutions to problems using critical thinking skills, independently and in teams
-   Adapting to changing situations
-   Practicing personal integrity and honesty
-   Engaging in ongoing self-assessment and goal modification for their personal and professional improvement
-   Exhibiting respectful and empathetic behavior as they interact with peers, superiors, subordinates and customers
-   Listening attentively to verbal instructions, requests and other information

**Legal Responsibilities**

SP technicians must understand and maintain an awareness of the legal responsibilities and limitations and the implications of their actions within the healthcare delivery setting. To do so, they must:

-   Comply with established risk management factors and procedures
-   Determine when an incident must be reported
-   Maintain confidentiality
-   Operate within the required scope of practice
-   Follow mandated standards for workplace safety
-   Comply with legal requirements for documentation

**Ethics**

Ethics relates to knowing the difference between "right" and "wrong." In the healthcare environment, it means conforming to accepted and professional standards of conduct. Ethical behavior is "doing the right thing in the right way:' Ethics should govern and guide the way SP technicians act and make decisions. They must always:

-   Respect patient rights
-   Promote justice and the equal treatment of all individuals
-   Recognize the importance of the patient's needs over other considerations
-   Report any activity that adversely affects the health, safety or welfare of patients, visitors or fellow workers
-   Comply with regulatory guidelines, facility policies, and departmental policies and procedures
-   Respect differences among team members
-   Demonstrate professionalism when interacting with customers and co-workers

**Safety Practices**

Successful SP technicians understand existing and potential hazards to patients, co-workers and themselves. They prevent injury or illness through safe work practices, and they consistently follow health and safety policies and procedures.

**They do so as they:**

-   Practice infection prevention procedures
-   Use **Standard Precautions** to control the spread of infection
-   Practice appropriate cleaning, disinfecting and sterilizing protocols
-   Apply principles of body mechanics
-   Use equipment properly
-   Follow emergency procedures and protocols
-   Comply with regulatory guidelines

**Resource Management**

SP technicians must understand the roles and responsibilities of individual members as part of the healthcare team. Examples include:

-   Controlling costs and reducing waste
-   Providing quality service
-   Practicing time management skills
-   Identifying and solving potential problems
-   Using inventory appropriately

**Other skills are also required of SP technicians. For example, they must:**

-   Practice established policies and procedures to prevent Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
-   Keep their work environment clean and organized
-   Identify and report fire and electrical hazards

New healthcare roles demand higher levels of skill than ever before for those working in SP. The complexities created by technology continue to grow and a new generation of healthcare professionals is emerging.

-   **Healthcare-associated infection (HAI):** An infection that is not present when a patient is admitted to a healthcare facility. If the infection develops in a patient on or after day three of admission to the healthcare facility, the infection is referred to as HAI.

**BASIC JOB RESPONSIBILITIES**

SP technicians are accountable for many tasks. **Job descriptions** are used to define and communicate job duties and requirements to employees within an organization. *They* are intended to be overviews that capture the general purpose and major accountabilities of a job, and they are used for the following reasons:

To evaluate positions and determine compensation. They can be used in conjunction with other resources to establish a pay range for a given position.

To clarify expectations. Job descriptions outline key job duties, which can be reviewed at the time of hire to clarify performance standards and expectations. They should be reviewed regularly (typically annually) *by* both the supervisor and those who occupy the position.

To review performance. Job descriptions can be used during annual performance reviews.

Because SPDs vary in size and scope of service and because jobs within the SPD vary, there is no single job description that applies to all situations.

-   **Job description:** A Human Resources tool that identifies the major tasks performed by individuals in specific positions.

**CONCLUSION**

The SP environment is dynamic and fast paced. The work is challenging, highly technical and complex. The performance of this vital department has a major impact on the successful operation of many departments.

Inefficiencies in productivity, errors that create the need for rework, and poor-quality performance are costly to hospitals. With the ever-increasing costs of healthcare, SP professionals must conserve resources and minimize expenses.

SP is an evolving occupational discipline. Over the years, there have been dramatic changes and changes continue at a rapid pace. Conscientious SP professionals will find great satisfaction in knowing their efforts, service, special skills and due diligence are a part of *every* surgical procedure, every patient's recovery and *every* positive outcome.
