**INTRODUCTION**

Many surgical interventions have been developed to treat the human body and enable ii to heal. Sterile Processing (SP) technicians play an important role in the surgical support process by providing the instruments and supplies needed to perform specific surgeries. As members of the surgical team, developing a basic understanding of the human body can aid in communication with the Operating Room (OR) and can help facilitate requests.

The study of the human body requires an understanding of **anatomy** and **physiology.**

-   **Anatomy:** The study of the structure and relationship between body parts
-   **Physiology:** The study of the functions of body parts and the body as a whole

**ANATOMICAL POSITION**

Anatomical positioning is a system created to describe different body part positions and locations. It allows healthcare professionals to universally communicate those specific areas of the body to other professionals. Understanding anatomical positioning, terms and planes can help SP technicians gain a better appreciation for where, how and which instrumentation will be used for different surgical procedures. For example, in a total hip replacement procedure, different instrumentation is used for an anterior approach versus a posterior approach

**Anatomical Planes**

The use of anatomical planes is another method for describing portions of the body or the location of structures as they relate to other structures in the body.

**The following are three commonly used anatomical planes:**

1.  Transverse plane: Passes through the body, organ or structure, dividing into upper or superior and lower or inferior sections
2.  Coronal plane: Passes through the body, organ or structure, dividing into front or anterior and back or posterior sections
3.  Sagittal plane: Passes through the body, organ or structure, dividing into left and right halves

**CELLS, TISSUES AND ORGANS**

**Cells**

**Here are some facts about cells:**

-   They are the basic living unit of life.
-   The human body is comprised of more than 100 trillion cells
-   They vary in size, shape and function, depending upon their location in the body
-   The are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope
-   Within each cell are still smaller structures called organelles, microscopic organs that perform specific functions

**Functions of the cell: include respiration, nutrition, energy production, waste elimination, and reproduction**

Regardless of their size and shape, each human cell consists of three main parts: cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell membrane is porous and flexible and surrounds the cell to keep it separated from the outside environment. The cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm and allows and controls the passage of materials in and out of the cell. Examples include the absorption of oxygen and food and the elimination of waste products produced by the cell

-   The **cytoplasm:** is a clear, jelly-like substance that surrounds the nucleus and contains the cell fluid and organelles
-   The **nucleus:** is surrounded and protected by the cytoplasm. This oval structure serves as the brain center of the cell to direct and control all activities, including duplication into two new cells.
-   **Cell:** The basic unit of life; the smallest structural unit of living organisms capable of performing all basic functions of life.
-   **Cell membrane:** The outer covering of a cell that regulates what enters and leaves it.
-   **Cytoplasm:** The clear Jelly-like substance of a cell between the cell membrane and nucleus.
-   **Nucleus:** The functional center of a cell that governs activity and heredity.

Living cells only come from other living cells.

**Tissue**

**Tissue:** forms when two or more cells that are similar in structure and function join together.

**The four primary tissues of the human body are:**

1.  **Epithelial tissue:** Covers the body's external surface (skin) and the linings of body cavities like the mouth, cars, nose and throat
2.  **Connective tissue:** Provides support, stores energy, and connects other tissues and parts. Examples of connective tissue include bone, fat, blood and cartilage. Bones provide protection, support and shape to the body as well as storage for calcium. Fat keeps the body warm, cushions organs and stores nutrients. Blood transports food and oxygen to all body parts and removes waste products. Cartilage provides framework and support to the human body.
3.  **Muscular tissue:** Shortens as it contracts. When attached to bone, these contractions make body movement possible. Muscle tissue also lines the inner walls of organs that contract to help food pass through the digestive system. As cardiac muscles contract, blood is pumped throughout the body.
4.  **Nervous tissue:** Located throughout the body. When stimulated, nervous tissue carries messages back and forth between the brain and every part of the body.

**Organs**

**Organs:** are formed when two or more different types of tissues are grouped together to perform a specific function.

**Examples of organs include:**

-   **Brain:** The organ in the central nervous system that is the primary receiver, organizer and distributor of information in the body
-   **Heart:** Pumps blood throughout the body
-   **Stomach:** Part of the digestive system that helps digest food by mixing it with digestive juices and converting it into a liquid
-   **Skin:** The largest organ serves as the body's outer covering
-   **Tissue:** A group of similar cells that perform a specialized function
-   **Organ:** A part of the body containing two or more tissues that function together for a specific purpose

**BODY SYSTEMS**

A **body system** is a group of organs that work together to carry out a particular activity. While each body system provides a specific bodily function, none are independent of one another. Except for the reproductive system, each body system and its organs work together to help the body function as a total organism and maintain life. The remainder of this chapter will provide details about the body's major systems and common procedures performed to treat issues that can occur in those systems.

**Skeletal System**

Without the skeletal system the body would be an immovable mass. Approximately 206 bones comprise the body's skeletal system. They are arranged in an orderly manner and are fastened together by tough connective tissue known as **tendons** and **ligaments.**

**The five main functions of the skeletal system are to:**

1.  Give the body shape and support
2.  Allow movement
3.  Protect vital organs
4.  Produce blood cells
5.  Store calcium

Most bones are made from cartilage, but through a process known as **ossification,** cartilage is sometimes replaced by bone. Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue that provides framework to the body.

**Its purposes include:**

-   Supporting body structures such as the ears and nose
-   Connecting the ribs to the sternum
-   Serving as a cushion between bones to prevent them from rubbing together at junctures and joints

**There are several types of joints:**

-   **Gliding joints:** Allow the head to lower as the vertebrae or bones in the spinal column of the neck to slide over one another
-   **Ball and socket joints:** Allow movements like swinging one’s arm in a circle. Ball and socket joints consist of a bone with a rounded head that fits into a rounded cup of another bone, examples: hips and shoulders
-   **Pivot joints -** Allow a turning motion such as the palm of the hand rotating from up to down
-   **Hinge joints:** Allow backward and forward bending motions like a door hinge, examples: knees, knuckles and elbows

A joint is a place where two bones meet. Some are immovable such as those found in the skull; others, such as the knee and elbow joints, are movable and allow the bones that they connect to move. Figure 3.6 shows the location of some joints in the body.

-   **Body system:** A group of organs that work together to carry out a specific activity
-   **Tendon:** A cord of fibrous tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone
-   **Ligament:** A band of connective tissue that connects a bone to another bone
-   **Cartilage:** A type of flexible connective tissue
-   **Ossification:** The process by which cartilage is replaced by bone
-   **Joint:** A place where two bones meet

The overall covering or lining of a joint is called a synovial membrane. It secretes a fluid, called synovial fluid, to lubricate joint surfaces.

Bones are comprised of living tissue and their strength and hardness come from chemical substances called minerals. Bone consists of two principal materials:

A hard outer material called cortical bone that is dense and strong and consists of calcium and phosphorus. This hard outer surface is surrounded by the periosteum, a tough membrane that contains bone-forming cells and blood vessels.

The inner section, called spongy or cancellous bone, is porous.

Bones are filled with a material called marrow. A pipeline of blood vessels and nerves runs through the middle of thick bones.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the skeletal system include:**

-   **Craniotomy:** Making an opening into the skull bone to access the brain.
-   **Anterior cervical fusion:** Removal of disc tissue pressing on a nerve in the neck area by inserting a piece of bone between the vertebrae and fusing this area with plates and screws.
-   **Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF)**: Removing disc tissue pressing on the lower spine area by inserting a piece of bone between the vertebrae and fusing this area with plates and screws.
-   **Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF):** Making an incision in the skin, realigning a fractured bone, and inserting screws and plates to ensure the bone ends do not move, so healing can be promoted.
-   **Total knee arthroplasty (TKA):** Removing the bone at the distal (farthest) end of the femur and the bone at the proximal (nearest) end of the tibia and replacing them with implants.
-   **Hip pinning:** Stabilizing broken hip bones with surgical screws, nails, rods or plates. Also known as internal fixation of the hip.
-   Trigger finger release - Making a small incision in the palm, then cutting the tendon sheath tunnel to widen it and allow the tendon to slide through it more easily.
-   **Tibial osteotomy**: A procedure to realign the knee by wedging open the upper shin bone (tibia) to reconfigure the knee joint. The weight-bearing part of the knee is shifted from degenerative or worn tissue onto healthier tissue.

Muscular System

The muscular system works with the skeletal system to enable movement of the body or materials through the body. Even as one sleeps, many of the more than 600 muscles in the body, including 400 that are skeletal, are actively at work. For example:

1.  Heart muscles contract to pump blood throughout the body.
2.  Chest muscles contract to move air in and out of the lungs.
3.  Muscles in the digestive tract move food and fluid through the body.
4.  Muscles throughout the body contract to produce heat and maintain the body's core temperature.

Muscles are comprised of long, thin cells or fibers that run parallel to one another and they are bundled together by connective tissue, called **fascia.** Muscle fibers have the ability to contract (shorten), and this contraction causes body movements.

-   **Fascia:** Band or sheet of fibrous connective tissue

There are three types of muscle tissue: **skeletal, smooth and cardiac.**

-   **Skeletal muscles:** Attached to bones by tendons. As skeletal muscles contract, the arms, legs, head or other body parts to which they are attached move. Skeletal muscles are consciously controlled; they move only when we want them to move.
-   **Smooth muscles:** Organized into thin, flat sheets of tissue. Smooth muscles are called involuntary or visceral muscles because they contract and function without conscious control. They control breathing and the movement of food and fluid in the digestive system, movement of blood throughout the circulatory system, and movement of urine through the urinary system.
-   **Cardiac muscle:** Similar to woven mesh fibers that branch out through the heart to give it more strength to pump blood. These involuntary, durable muscle fibers contract and make the heartbeat. In a healthy heart, these fibers typically do not tire.

To function properly, these muscle fibers require energy derived from consumed food and oxygen derived from the environment when we breathe. Their functions include movement and support, the maintenance of posture and body position, and the production of body heat.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the muscular system include:**

-   **Fasciotomy:** Making an incision into the fibrous membrane covering a muscle, usually to relieve pressure from an injured or swollen muscle.
-   **Herniorrhaphy:** Repairing a cavity wall or muscle layer that allows all or part of an organ to project through the opening.
-   **Rotator cuff repair:** Repairing the muscles and ligaments of shoulder joints. Frequently used methods are the Bankart, Putti-Platt, and Bristow procedures.
-   **Muscle biopsy:** Removing a small sample of muscle tissue for testing in a laboratory.
-   **Tendon repair:** Retrieves a torn tendon and reattaches it to soft tissue or bone with either a small incision or arthroscopic techniques
-   **Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair:** Rebuilding the ligament in the center of the knee with a new ligament from the patient's own body, or from a donor, usually by knee arthroscopy. In some cases, ACL repair is done by making an incision into the knee.

Nervous System

The nervous system is a vast communication network. It coordinates and carries messages between all parts of the body and enables us to be aware of changes in the environment­ and to react accordingly. A complex series of nervous tissues, somewhat like electrical wiring, runs from the brain and spinal cord throughout the entire body.

The nervous system controls all body functions and allows the body to respond to stimuli. Many reactions are automatic such as blinking when a foreign object approaches the eye. Nerve tissue carries electrical messages from the brain and spinal cord that signal muscles to contract. Other actions are more conscious and involve emotion, reason and memory. Like a computer, the brain stores information based on past experiences that can later be communicated to the body by the nervous system.

Anatomically, the nervous system is divided into two parts: the **central nervous system (CNS)** and the **peripheral nervous system (PNS).**

The CNS consists of the **brain** and spinal cord, which are covered by protective membranes called meninges. The CNS is the body's control center and storehouse for information about what is happening or has happened within or outside the body. The brain, a spongy and complex organ, is the main control unit of the CNS. It is comprised of more than 100 billion nerve cells, the brain is divided into three parts, each carrying out a specific function: **cerebrum, cerebellum** and **brain stem.**

-   **Central nervous system (CNS):** The part of the nervous system that includes the brain and spinal cord.
-   **Peripheral nervous system (PNS):** All nerve tissue outside the CNS.
-   **The Brain:** The main control unit of the CNS.
-   **Cerebrum:** The largest part of the brain. It controls mental activities and movement
-   **Cerebellum:** The second largest part of the brain. It controls muscle coordination, body balance and posture
-   **Brain stem:** Controls many automatic body functions such as heartbeat and breathing

The **Cerebrum** is the largest part of the human brain

-   It manages the nerve impulses that allow us to think, speak and remember
-   Controls most voluntary muscle contractions
-   Interprets information gathered by the senses
-   Influences the foundation of personality, emotions and attitudes

The cerebrum is divided into two halves (hemispheres). Each half controls different mental activities and movement on the opposite side of the body. A series of nerve pathways run between each half to facilitate communication.

The cerebellum is located inferior (below) and posterior (behind) the cerebrum. It is the second largest part of the brain, and its role is to adjust the motor impulses that control muscular coordination, body balance and posture.

The brain stem is located at the base of the brain and is formed by bundles of nerves that extend from the cerebrum and cerebellum. The lowest part of the brain stem (the medulla oblongata) joins the brain to the spinal cord. It contains nerve centers that control many automatic body functions, including heartbeat and breathing.

The PNS involves the network of nerves and sense organs that branch out of the CNS and connect the CNS to other parts of the body. One part (the autonomic nervous system) controls all involuntary body processes, like heartbeat and **peristalsis.** Other nerves are under direct control of the conscious mind. When someone tells their hand to wave, for example, a message is sent from the brain, down the spinal cord, and through a peripheral nerve to the hand.

-   **Peristalsis:** The rippling motion of muscles in the digestive tract that mixes food with gastric juices to form a thin liquid.

Sense Organs

Sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin) are accessory structures of the nervous system that provide an impression of all that surrounds us. These organs house special sensory receptors that are message-carrying structures. Most sense organs respond to stimuli from outside the body, while others keep track of the body's internal environment. They respond to light, sound, taste, chemicals, heat and pressure.

**Eyes**

**Eyes are the organs of vision. They produce images by focusing light rays that are interpreted by the brain. Eyes consist of three layers of tissue:**

-   **Sclera:** The white portion of the eye that serves as an outer coat to provide protection. At the center front of the sclera is a transparent protective shield called the cornea.
-   **Choroid:** The middle layer of the eye that furnishes nourishment to the eye via blood vessels. The choroid layer includes the iris, a muscle that is the colored portion of the eye. A circular opening, called the pupil, is found at the center of the iris; it controls the amount of light entering the eye as it narrows or widens. Between the cornea and eye lens is the aqueous humor, a watery-like fluid that fills the anterior (front) compartment of the eye.
-   **Retina:** The eye's third layer, located on the back surface of the eyeball. The eye lens focuses light onto the retina, which contains light-sensitive cells (receptors) that receive and transmit impressions to the brain through the optic nerve. The vitreous humor is a fluid-filled compartment of the eye that gives the eyeball its round shape.

**Ears**

Ears are the organs of hearing. They are comprised of three parts: the outer, middle and inner ear.  Sound waves travel through the ear to the auditory nerve that transmits nerve impulses to the brain. The ear allows us to hear in the following ways:

The outer ear serves as a funnel that gathers sound waves and passes them through the ear canal to the tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum).

The eardrum consists of a tightly stretched membrane that separates the outer ear canal from the middle ear. Vibrations of the eardrum enter the middle ear, which contains three tiny bones: the malleus, incus and stapes.

When sound vibrations are then passed through these bones into the fluid-filled inner ear. There, vibrations are channeled through the fluid into a spiral-shaped tube called the cochlea, which contains the receptors or nerve endings that transmit nerve impulses to the brain.

The inner ear also contains semi-circular canals consisting of three curved tubes filled with fluid. Body balance is regulated by this fluid as it shifts with body movement. As the fluid shifts, it presses against tiny hairs, stimulating nerve impulses that travel to the brain. The brain responds to these impulses by coordinating muscle movement.

Nose

The nose is the organ of smell and consists of many sensory receptors or cells. ll1ese receptors are located in the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and are sensitive to chemicals carried through the air. The olfactory nerve endings extend to the receptors and are stimulated by different odors. Olfactory bulbs are the enlarged portion at the ends of the olfactory nerves.

Tongue

The tongue is the organ of taste and is covered with taste buds (sensory receptors). The sense of taste, like smell, is a chemical sense. Chemicals are carried by saliva throughout the mouth. Taste buds located in different areas of the tongue can distinguish four kinds of taste: sweet, sour, bitter and salty. There are 80 different types of chemical odors, and the combination of taste and odors produces flavors.

Skin

The skin is the largest body organ and contains many nerve endings at and below its surface. Skin, therefore, acts as an important sensory organ. Touch receptors near the skin's surface allow us to distinguish textures and respond to heat and cold. Further below the skin's surface are receptors that respond to touch and pressure. The sense of pain stimulates nerves and sends messages of potential danger to the brain.

**There are numerous surgical procedures involving the nervous system including:**

-   **Cataract extraction with implant:** Removing a clouded eye lens and replacing it with a clear, artificial lens
-   **Craniotomy:** Creating an opening in the skull to expose the brain to facilitate procedures, such as the removal of tumors and clots.
-   **Carpal tunnel repair:** Removal of tissue or displaced bone in the wrist area to release pressure on the median nerve.
-   **Ulnar nerve transposition:** Making an incision at the elbow area, allowing the ulnar nerve to be moved to an area that provides protection and comfort.
-   **Corneal transplant:** Grafting corneal tissue from a donor eye to another to improve vision when the cornea is damaged or scarred.
-   **Bilateral myringotomy with tubes (BMT):** Making an incision into the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to permit fluid to drain. Small tubes are placed in the membrane to allow continuous drainage. The tubes fall out as the membrane heals.
-   **Stapedectomy:** Removal of the stapes (an ear bone) when it has thickened and no longer transmits sound waves. It is replaced with an artificial implant to improve hearing.
-   **Tympanoplasty:** Reconstructing the eardrum, so sound waves can be sent to the middle and inner ear.
-   **Split-thickness skin graft (STSG):** Cutting the skin (graft) from a donor site. The graft is then transplanted onto the surgical area.

Endocrine System

The endocrine system adapts to changes in the environment. During times of excitement, stress or when one feels threatened, how does the body react? Chances are muscles tense, the heartbeat quickens, and breathing rhythm changes. These rapid changes in bodily functions are set in motion by the **hormones** or secretions produced by the glands of the endocrine system. These glands and the substances they produce have a profound influence on bodily functions, such as **metabolism,** growth and personality.

Because hormones are distributed throughout the body, the endocrine glands that produce them are not necessarily next to the organs they control. Regardless of where hormones enter the bloodstream, they continue their journey through the circulatory system until they reach their targeted organ. Tissue cells and organs recognize and accept hormones made for them and reject others that are not.

The nervous system and endocrine system work together. When the brain interprets information as a threat, it rapidly sends nerve impulses that trigger certain endocrine glands to release their hormones into the bloodstream. In a fearful situation, the hormones cause heartbeat acceleration and prepare muscles for action. In this state, one is ready for “fight or flight” (to defend or run).

**The major glands of the endocrine system include:**

-   **Pituitary gland:** A small, pea-shaped gland located at the base of the brain. It is considered the master gland because it helps control the activities of all other endocrine glands. Its secretions also stimulate skeletal and body growth, development of sex organs, regulation of blood pressure, the reproductive process, and muscle development.
-   **Thyroid gland:** Located at the base of the neck, just below the larynx (voice box). Its hormones help regulate the rate of metabolism and maintain the body's levels of calcium and phosphorus.
-   Parathyroid glands: Four pea-shaped glands located on (or sometimes in) the thyroid that control the blood's calcium level.
-   **Adrenal glands:** During sudden stress, these glands, which are located on top of each kidney, release adrenaline that increases heart rate and physical strength. Adrenaline also enhances the ability to think and respond more quickly than usual in emergency situations.
-   **Pancreas:** Located just below the stomach, this gland contains cells organized into groups, known as the islets of Langerhans. Two primary hormones are produced by the pancreatic islets: **insulin,** which reduces the level of sugar in the bloodstream, and **glucagon,** which can increase the blood's sugar level.
-   **Ovaries:** Female sex glands that produce two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen is responsible for the development of female characteristics, and progesterone, together with estrogen, regulates the menstrual cycle.
-   **Testes:** Male sex glands that produce the hormone testosterone that stimulates the development of masculine characteristics.
-   **Hormones:** Chemical messengers that travel through the blood and act on target organs
-   **Metabolism:** The total chemical changes by which the nutritional and functional activities of an organism are maintained
-   **Insulin:** A hormone that reduces the level of sugar in the blood
-   **Glucagon:** A hormone that can increase the blood sugar level

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the endocrine system include:**

-   **Thyroidectomy:** Removal of all or part of the thyroid gland.
-   **Oophorectomy:** Removal of an ovary.
-   **Orchiectomy:** Removal of a testicle.
-   **Pituitary tumor resection:** Removal of a tumor on the pituitary gland.
-   **Thyroid excision**: Removal of nodules and/or goiters (enlargements) on the thyroid.
-   **Adrenalectomy:** Removal of one or both (bilateral adrenalectomy) adrenal glands.

Reproductive System

Life begins as a single cell, formed when two other cells join in a process called fertilization. The male sex cell is produced by the male reproductive system and is called sperm. The female sex cell (egg) is called ovum (plural: ova) and is produced by the female reproductive system. Both sperm and ovum contain rod­ shaped structures called chromosomes that are responsible for inherited characteristics passed on from parent to child. Each sex cell contains 23 chromosomes; therefore, a fertilized egg consists of 46 chromosomes, receiving 23 from the sperm and 23 from the ovum.

The male reproductive system consists of two testes. These oval­ shaped glands are located in a skin-covered, pouch-like structure called the scrotum. Two tube structures are also in the scrotum. The epididymis is a tube that carries sperm cells from the testes to the vas deferens, a thick-walled tube structure approximately 18 inches long, where they mature. The vas deferens then carries sperm to a hollow chamber, called the seminal vesicle, located behind the bladder.

The seminal vesicle joins with the vas deferens to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of the seminal vesicle are called **semen,** which bathes and nourishes the sperm cells. In the **ejaculatory duct,** the semen-containing sperm enters the **urethra** which, upon ejaculation, transfers the sperm to the female's body.

The **prostate gland** is a partly glandular and partly muscular gland that surrounds the neck of the bladder. It secretes a fluid, which is part of the semen and stimulates sperm motility (movement).

The female reproductive system consists of the **vagina,** a muscular canal approximately 4½ inches long through which a baby passes during birth. It extends from an external opening to the **cervix** (neck of the uterus). The **uterus** is located between the rectum and urinary bladder and is a hollow, pear-shaped organ. It is lined with a fluffy vascular layer of tissue called **endometrium.** The fertilized ovum embeds itself into the endometrium, which sloughs off (separates) during menstruation if the ovum is not fertilized.

The **fallopian tubes** (oviducts) extend from two openings on each side of the anterior portion of the uterus. The distal (farthest) ends of the fallopian tubes are funnel-shaped, and finger-like projections, called **fimbriae,** extend from them. They are located near, but not attached to, the **ovaries.** The fimbriae draw the ovum into the fallopian tube where it travels to the uterus.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the reproductive system include:**

-   **Orchiopexy:** Relocating a non-descended testicle to the correct location in the scrotum
-   **Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP):** Removal of part of the prostate gland through the insertion of instruments across the urethra to reach the prostate internally
-   **Radical prostatectomy:** Removal of the prostate gland using an incision in the abdomen and the urinary bladder
-   **Hysterectomy:** Removal of the uterus
-   **Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO):** Removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries
-   **Sperm:** Male sex cell
-   **Ovum:** Female sex cell (egg)
-   **Chromosomes:** Rod-shaped structures responsible for inherited characteristics passed on from parent to child
-   **Testes:** Male reproductive gland that forms and secretes sperm and several fluid elements in semen.
-   **Scrotum:** Sac in which testes are suspended.
-   **Epididymis:** A tube that carries sperm cells from the testes to the vas deferens.
-   **Vas deferens:** A duct that transfers sperm from the epididymis to the seminal vesicle.
-   **Seminal vesicle:** A gland that produces semen.
-   **Semen:** Mixture of sperm cells and secretions from several male reproductive glands.
-   **Ejaculatory duct:** A duct formed by joining the seminal vesicle with the vas deferens, through which semen moves during ejaculation.
-   **Urethra:** Tube that discharges urine.
-   **Prostate gland:** Produces a fluid element in semen that stimulates the movement of sperm.
-   **Vagina:** Muscular canal in a female that extends from an external opening to the neck of the uterus.
-   **Cervix:** Lower end (neck) of the uterus.
-   **Uterus:** Female organ within which the fetus develops during pregnancy
-   **Endometrium:** Lining of the uterus.
-   **Fallopian tubes:** slender tubes that convey the ova (eggs) from the ovaries to the uterus.
-   **Fimbriae:** Finger-like projections extending from the fallopian tubes that draw ova (eggs) into the uterus
-   **Ovaries:** Female reproductive organs
-   **Endometrial ablation -** Scarring or removal of the inner lining of the uterus to treat abnormal bleeding
-   **Dilation and curettage (D&C):** Widening of the cervix (opening of the uterus) to permit evacuation of the contents or scraping of the lining of the uterus
-   **Ectopic pregnancy:** Removal of a fertilized ovum growing in the fallopian tube to prevent complications, such as hemorrhage, shock and scarring of the fallopian tube
-   **Pelviscopy:** Visualization of the pelvic cavity (lower abdomen) using an endoscope for medical diagnosis or treatment of female reproductive organs
-   **Tubal ligation:** Cutting, burning, tying or applying a clip on the fallopian tubes to prevent future pregnancies
-   **Vasectomy:** A surgical procedure for male sterilization and/ or birth control
-   **Urethra:** A membranous canal or tube that connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body to eliminate urine. In males, the urethra is approximately 20cm long; it passes through the prostate gland and pelvic wall and extends through the **penis.** The female urethra is about 4cm long; it runs from the bladder through the sphincter muscle to the external meatus or the opening, located at the anterior or the front of the vagina

Urinary and Excretory Systems

The urinary system provides "pollution control" by eliminating bodily waste. This process takes place as blood is filtered by the urinary system. Urine is a water solution consisting of various waste substances that are products of metabolism. It obtains its color from excreted bile pigments and may be a shade of amber, pale yellow or clear. Depending on the amount of liquid intake or loss through perspiration, an average adult may excrete between 1000cc and l800cc of urine during a 24-hour period. In males, the urinary and reproductive systems are closely related and comprise the genitourinary system. In females, however, the two systems are not interrelated.

**Organs of the urinary system in both sexes include:**

-   **Kidneys:** Two bean-shaped organs that contain a vast network of vessels and tubules, called nephron, that act as a filter to remove excess water and waste from the blood to produce urine.
-   **Ureters:** Two tube-like structures that extend from each kidney and connect to the urinary bladder. The peristaltic (automatic constriction and relaxation) action of the ureters moves urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
-   **Urinary bladder:** Serves as a reservoir for urine. It is a muscular, membranous sack located in the pelvis, just anterior (front) of the sigmoid colon and posterior to (behind) the pubis. The bladder is flexible, and its size depends on the amount of urine present ranges from 300cc to 500cc in adults). As the amount of urine in the urinary bladder increases, it applies pressure on the bladder walls, sending an impulse to the CNS. As the bladder wall contracts, the sphincter muscle at the junction of the urethra relaxes and urine is released.
-   **Kidneys:** Organs that remove excess water and waste substances from the blood in a process that yields urine
-   **Ureters:** Tube-like structures extending from the kidneys to the urinary bladder that move urine between these organs
-   **Urinary bladder:** The reservoir for urine
-   **Penis** Male organ of urination and intercourse
-   **The excretory system:** removes toxic (poisonous) waste substances. The kidneys (urinary system) and lungs (respiratory system) also perform excretory functions, as do the **liver** and **skin**
-   **Liver:** An organ that filters the blood to remove amino acids and neutralize some harmful toxins
-   **Skin:** This organ contains sweat glands that, through the process of perspiration, produce and excrete sweat.

The **liver** is another filter for the blood. It removes amino acids and can neutralize some harmful toxins. It can also convert hemoglobin from worn-out blood cells into substances the body requires.

**Skin contains sweat glands, oils, hair and nails.** Sweat glands remove excess water, salt and other bodily wastes. These are located in the dermis (inner layer of skin) and consist of coiled tubes connected to pores in the skin's surface. The sweat glands, through the process of perspiration, produce and excrete sweat. Perspiration rids the body of waste and helps regulate the body's temperature by cooling its outside surface. The excretion of oil by the sebaceous glands keeps the skin soft and prevents hair from becoming too dry or brittle.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the urinary system include:**

-   **Cystoscopy:** Viewing the urinary bladder using an endoscope
-   **Nephrectomy:** Removal of the kidney
-   **Lithotripsy (kidney stone shock wave treatment):** Serves to crush stones that form in the kidney and become stuck in a ureter. The procedure involves decreasing the size of the stones with a laser or shock waves or removing them using a long, flexible instrument called a stone basket.

**Respiratory System**

The respiratory system supplies the body with oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.

This exchange of gases is accomplished automatically as one breathes in a two-step process: inspiration (inhaling air into the lungs) and expiration (exhaling air from the lungs). Air contains impurities, such as dirt, dust and microorganisms, and these are filtered out by the respiratory system.

**The primary organs of the respiratory system are:**

-   **Nose, also known as the** nasal cavity and **mouth:** During inspiration, air enters the nostrils (nasal openings) and mouth. Air in the nose is filtered, moistened and warmed.
-   **Pharynx:** Air passes to the pharynx (throat), which is the crossroads of the nose, mouth, voice box and **esophagus.** Food continues down the esophagus, while air passes through the **larynx, or the** voice box to the **trachea.**
-   **Trachea (windpipe):** The trachea divides into two tube-like structures, the right and left **bronchi,** that extend into the **lungs.**
-   **Lungs**: Air continues through the bronchi to the bronchioles, a series of many smaller tubes extending from each bronchus, which looks somewhat like a branch of a tree. At the end of each bronchiole are small clusters of air sacs, called alveoli, that comprise the lungs' tissue. Alveoli and each alveolus are covered by a thin wall surrounded by a vast network of capillaries, the tiny blood vessels. The blood then picks up oxygen from the inspired air and releases the waste gas, carbon dioxide, during expiration.

The right lung consists of three lobes. The left lung consists of two lobes to allow space for the heart.

The lungs are located in the thoracic cavity(chest), where they are covered by thin membranes, called pleura, and protected by the skeletal rib cage and sternum. The pleura secretes a lubricating fluid that permits smooth movement of the lungs during the respiratory Cycle.

-   **Nose:** Organ of smell; also filters the air we breathe
-   **Mouth:** Opening through which air, food and beverages enter the body; beginning of the alimentary canal
-   **Pharynx:** Throat
-   **Esophagus:** Connects the throat to the stomach
-   **Larynx:** Voice box.
-   **Trachea:** Windpipe
-   **Bronchi:** The main passageway for air to travel from the trachea to the lungs.
-   **Lungs:** Main organs of the respiratory system whose function is transporting oxygen into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from the blood
-   **Diaphragm:** A muscle located below the lungs. The diaphragm contracts and causes the chest cavity to expand to allow more space for air. During expiration, it relaxes, and air is forced out of the lungs.
-   Examples of surgical procedures involving the respiratory system include:
-   **Thoracotomy:** Making an opening into the thoracic cavity (chest) to give surgeons access to the lungs and heart.
-   **Thoracoscopy:** Viewing the thoracic (chest) cavity with an endoscope for diagnosis or treatment
-   **Pneumonectomy:** Removal of a lung
-   **Tracheotomy:** Making an incision into the trachea
-   **Lobectomy:** Removal of a lobe of an organ, usually referring to the brain, lung or liver
-   **Laryngectomy:** Removal of the larynx (voice box)
-   **Bronchoscopy:** Visualizing the bronchus with an endoscope
-   **Septoplasty:** Straightening or removing cartilage and/or bone in the nose when the nasal septum is deformed, injured or fractured
-   **Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS):** Removal of bone defects or inflamed tissue of the paranasal sinuses to allow the sinuses to drain

Digestive System

The human body, like any other complex piece of machinery, requires a source of energy or fuel to keep it functioning. The body gets its fuel from the chemicals (nutrients) in food.

The function of the digestive system is to convert food into energy for the body.'n1e human body requires six basic categories of nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, water, minerals and vitamins. A well-balanced diet is important for keeping the body healthy and strong.

The process of digestion breaks food down mechanically and chemically so il can be absorbed by body cells or discharged as waste. The pathway that food takes through the digestive system is called the **alimentary canal** (digestive tract). The alimentary canal is approximately 30 feet long and consists of the mouth, esophagus, **stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum** and **anus.** The liver, gallbladder and pancreas are accessory organs of the digestive system. The salivary, gastric and intestinal glands are accessory structures to the digestive system that contribute to the process of digestion.

**A review of the components of the alimentary canal allows us to study the digestive process:**

-   **Mouth:** The digestive process begins in the mouth. There, food is softened by saliva secreted by salivary glands located throughout the mouth. The teeth tear and grind the softened food into smaller particles that allow it to be easily swallowed. The food then passes through the esophagus.
-   **Esophagus:** A somewhat flexible, muscular tube that produces peristaltic contractions, which move food into the stomach.
-   **Stomach:** An elongated and muscular shaped pouch that serves as a reservoir for food as gastric gland secretions (mucin, hydrochloric acid and enzymes) convert the food into a semi-liquid material called chyme.
-   **Small intestine:** From the stomach, the liquified food enters the small intestine (an organ approximately 20 to 23 feet long). This is where the greatest amount of digestion and absorption of nutrients into body cells occurs. The small intestine is divided into three portions: duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Bile (produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder), along with pancreatic and intestinal juices, facilitates digestion in the small intestine.
-   **Large intestine (colon):** Material that is not absorbed by the small intestine enters the large intestine (colon), which is approximately five to six feet long. The first few inches of the large intestine are called the cecum, from which the appendix extends. The large intestine consists of six portions: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum and anus. Peristaltic action moves food through the large intestine where the absorption of water and electrolytes or salt occurs.
-   **Rectum and anus:** The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine where the remaining waste (feces) becomes dehydrated and is eliminated through the anus.
-   **Alimentary canal:** The pathway that food takes through the digestive system; also called digestive tract.
-   **Stomach:** A pouch that serves as a reservoir for food that has been consumed.
-   **Small intestine:** The organ in the digestive system where the greatest amount of digestion and absorption of nutrients into the body cells occurs.
-   **Large intestine (colon):** The digestive organ that dehydrates digestive residues (feces).
-   **Rectum:** The last several inches of the large intestine.
-   **Anus:** The lower opening of the alimentary canal.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the digestive system include:**

-   **Appendectomy:** Removal of the appendix
-   **Parotidectomy:** Removal of a salivary gland (parotid) because of tumor formation
-   **Gastrectomy:** Removal of the stomach. Other procedures include removal of portions of the stomach, examples are hemigastrectomy or gastric sleeve
-   **Gastric bypass:** Isolating a small portion of the stomach and suturing part of the small intestine to it to treat morbid obesity. Food intake is then limited to the small part of the stomach.
-   **Cholecystectomy:** Removal of the gallbladder with a surgical incision or by endoscopic surgery, called laparoscopic cholecystectomy
-   **Colectomy:** Removal of all or part of the large intestine
-   **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy:** Removal of the gallbladder with endoscopic instrumentation

Circulatory System

The circulatory system is the body's primary transportation network. It delivers nutrients and oxygen to body cells and carries away carbon dioxide and other harmful waste products. This is accomplished as blood is pumped through 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body.

The lymphatic system is a subsidiary of the circulatory system and serves a vital role in the body's defense against disease. The lymphatic system consists of a series of tiny vessels located throughout the body that carry clear liquid fluid (lymph) that originates from blood plasma. Large numbers of lymph nodes (tissue masses containing special cells called lymphocytes) that filter bacteria and other harmful materials out of the lymph are located in the lymph and blood vessels. Lymph flows from the lymph vessels into two veins located in the neck region to return lost fluid back into the bloodstream.

Tonsils are one type of lymph node, and they are located on both sides of the base of the tongue in the throat.

Sentinel lymph nodes are frequently identified during cancer surgery. The surgeon tries to find the first (sentinel) lymph node where the cancer cells have started to spread.

-   **Blood:** is a type of connective tissue fluid that moves throughout the circulatory system and transports many important substances. The body contains an average of five to seven liters of blood. Blood is a mixture of plasma, red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets:
-   **Plasma:** More than 55% of blood is made up of plasma, a yellowish liquid that is composed of water (92%) and proteins. Plasma serves as the vehicle of transportation for dissolved nutrients, enzymes, waste and other substances through the body.
-   **Red blood cells:** These structures have thin centers that allow them to be pliable when moving through narrow capillaries. Red blood cells are rich in hemoglobin (an iron protein) that picks up oxygen in the lungs and transports it to all the body cells and then transports carbon dioxide back to the lungs. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and have a life span of approximately 120 days. Worn-out or damaged red blood cells are broken down in the liver and destroyed by the spleen.
-   **White blood cells:** Some white blood cells are twice as large as red blood cells and their life span can range from hours to years. White blood cells are also produced by bone marrow and their purpose is to attack, destroy and digest disease­ producing organisms that enter the body.
-   **Platelets:** These tiny cell fragments detach from bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. They have no color or nucleus and last for a maximum of 10 days. Enzymes released by the platelets act on other blood components to create fibrin. This chemical weaves across cells in blood vessels and traps blood cells and plasma that will harden and clot.
-   **Blood:** A type of connective tissue fluid that transports many substances throughout the circulatory system.
-   **Plasma:** The largest component of the blood. Plasma transports nutrients throughout the body and helps remove waste from the body.
-   **Red blood cells:** Blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body.
-   **White blood cells:** Blood cells that circulate in the blood and help defend the body against infection or foreign invaders.
-   **Platelets:** Blood cell fragments whose function is to help the blood to clot.

Circulation in the body is a continuous process, traveling the same route throughout the body all the time. Blood moves from the **heart** to the lungs and then back to the heart where it is pumped to all the cells of the body through a system of vessels. Blood then returns back to the heart to be recirculated.

The vessels that carry blood away from the heart are called **arteries. Veins** are the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. **Capillaries** are the tiny vessels abundant throughout the body that serve as connections between veins and arteries.

The heart is a muscular organ, about the size of a fist, that pumps five liters of blood through the body every minute, while resting only between beats. Located in its upper right side is a "pacemaker" that signals the heart muscle to contract; this controls the heartbeat.

**Here's how the heart works:**

The heart consists of four hollow chambers, two on each side.

A thick tissue wall, called the septum, separates the left and right sides of the heart.

The upper chambers of the heart are called **atria,** and the lower chambers are called **ventricles.**

Deoxygenated blood (blood that has had oxygen removed by the cells) returns to the heart and enters the right atrium.

As the right atrium becomes full, a tissue flap (called a heart valve) opens. It allows blood to flow into the right ventricle.

When the right ventricle is full, the valve closes to prevent backflow of blood.

As the right ventricle contracts, blood is forced out of the heart through the pulmonary artery and into the lungs where it is oxygenated.

The oxygenated blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium.

As the left atrium becomes full, the left atrium heart valve opens and the blood flows into the left ventricle. As the left ventricle becomes full, the left atrium valve closes, the left ventricle contracts, and oxygenated blood leaves the heart. As the heart contracts, blood is forced out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve into the **aorta,** the largest blood vessel in the body. The aorta is an artery that carries blood away from the heart and it branches out into a vast network of smaller arteries throughout the body. The left ventricle pumps blood throughout the entire body, working about six times as hard as the right ventricle, which only pumps blood a short distance.

-   **Heart:** The muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body.
-   **Arteries:** Vessels that carry blood away from the heart.
-   **Veins:** Vessels that carry blood back to the heart.
-   **Capillaries:** Vessels that serve as connections between veins and arteries.
-   **Atria:** The two upper chambers of the heart.
-   **Ventricles:** The two lower chambers of the heart.
-   **Aorta:** The largest blood vessel in the body.

**Examples of surgical procedures involving the circulatory system include:**

-   **Tonsillectomy:** Removal of lymph tissue in the pharynx (throat)
-   **Adenoidectomy:** Removal of tonsil tissue at the end of the soft palate (roof of the mouth)
-   **Arteriovenous (AV) fistula:** Suturing the radial artery and cephalic vein together in the lower arm to allow the dilated (enlarged) vein to be used for large bore needle insertion for renal dialysis
-   **Aneurysm repair:** abdominal aortic aneurysm, Triple A: Removing a weakened, balloon-like area in the aorta and replacing it with a synthetic product
-   **Pacemaker insertion:** A small electrical medical device implanted in a patient to make the heartbeat regularly
-   **Hemorrhoidectomy:** Removal of swollen, inflamed veins from the anus
-   **Coronary artery bypass graft, CABG:** Removal of a vein, usually from a lower limb, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary arteries
-   **Carotid endarterectomy:** A procedure to reduce the risk of stroke by removing plaque from the carotid artery that causes lack of brain oxygenation

ANATOMY AND INSTRUMENT NAMES

SP technicians who familiarize themselves with common aspects of human anatomy and physiology may find it easier to understand the need for specialized instruments to address a specific body system.

The names of many surgical instruments reflect the anatomical region for which they have been designed. For this reason, taking the time to learn how the body works will help SP technicians better understand the purpose of a particular instrument and help them remember its name.

Here are just a few examples of the hundreds of instruments that reflect the anatomical area from which their names are derived:

| **Aortic compressor** **Vaginal speculum** **Adenotome** **Eyelid retractor** **Urethratome** **Bowel forceps** | **Anal retractor** **Lacrimal duct probes** **Hip skid** **Uterine sounds** **Brain spatula**  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

**CONCLUSION**

While SP technicians do not provide direct patient care, an understanding of basic anatomy and common surgical procedures can help improve communication with surgery and other procedural units and, therefore, improve patient outcomes. A basic understanding of anatomical terms can also increase instrument knowledge. Both enhancements make it easier to function in the role of surgical support.

The human body is incredibly sophisticated. With its many parts, networks and functions, it is amazing to wonder how these various systems must work together and how disease or injury can disrupt the body system symphony. By gaining a basic understanding of how the body works and the common surgical procedures that are performed to treat certain conditions, SP technicians can become more knowledgeable about the instruments and devices in their care and improve their ability to communicate with the surgical team.
