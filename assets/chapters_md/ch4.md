INTRODUCTION

Sterile Processing (SP) technicians are sometimes daunted *by* microbiology because much of its terminology is unfamiliar and deals with a world that cannot be seen without a microscope; however, microorganisms have a dramatic impact on the world. For example, everyone has become sick with infections like colds or the flu.

Some microscopic organisms can cause serious illness and even death. How can something so small have such massive power over the human body? Why can anyone, even the strongest and healthiest person, become infected *by* microorganisms? Why does the risk of infection increase in those whose immune systems or natural body defenses are compromised? This chapter will help answer these and related questions about how these unseen organisms affect everyone.

OVERVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY

Most people have some understanding of **microbiology.** They know that it is not wise to eat food that falls on the floor, touch a sick person's soiled facial tissues or share eating utensils. They know they should wash their hands before eating and after using the restroom. They understand that taking these precautions helps to protect against germs.

**For the average person, this limited understanding of the world of microbes is typically enough; however, SP technicians must have a deeper understanding about microbiology for two reasons:**

1.  They have the responsibility to protect patients from microorganisms in the healthcare environment.
2.  The nature of SP technicians' job duties may increase the risk of exposure to harmful microorganisms for themselves and their co-workers.

**Microbiology:** The study of microorganisms. The scientific study of the nature, life and actions of microorganisms.

Microorganisms are tiny organisms that can only be seen with a microscope.

SP technicians should be able to recognize the conditions that favor the growth of microorganisms and recognize that even though microorganisms cannot be seen with the naked eye, they are present in the environment. The surgical instruments, equipment and utensils processed *by* SP personnel every day are **contaminated** with microorganisms that pose a threat to patients, SP technicians and other facility personnel.

-   **Contamination:** The state of being soiled by contact with infectious organisms or other materials.

**This chapter provides a broad overview of microbiology, including:**

-   Basic facts about microorganisms
-   Beneficial versus dangerous microorganisms
-   How microorganisms are identified and classified
-   The conditions microorganisms need to grow and reproduce
-   How microorganisms are transmitted
-   How microorganisms can be controlled and eliminated

Basic Facts About Microorganisms

Cells are the basic units of all living organisms (plants, animals, protozoa and bacteria) and they are the smallest unit that can live, grow and reproduce.

Cells differ in size and shape, but they all have:

-   **Nucleus:** the controlling unit of the cell
-   **Cytoplasm:** the material that fills the cell
-   **Cell membrane:** the outer membrane that allows some liquids and gases to seep in and out of the cell

Bacterial cells differ from both plant and animal cells because they have no membrane to separate the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Plants and animals have a nuclear membrane surrounding many strands.

BENEFICIAL VERSUS DANGEROUS MICROORGANISMS

Many microorganisms, or microbes, are harmless. In fact, 95% of bacteria are beneficial and essential; they are everywhere in nature and necessary for the existence of humans, plants and animals. For example, microorganisms maintain the balance of chemical elements in the natural environment by breaking down dead matter and recycling carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and other elements. Microorganisms are also useful in sewage treatment to convert waste materials into soluble, odorless compounds for disposal.

Harmless microorganisms are also found on human skin and hair, in the intestinal tract, and in some bodily discharges.

Microorganisms can cause infections when introduced into a body site where they are not typically found. Microorganisms that can cause illness are called **pathogens.** Pathogens cause disease by producing powerful toxins that interfere with how body systems work. Their uncontrolled reproduction can overwhelm body systems or cause tissues to degenerate.

Pathogens are a specific concern for SP technicians, as disease­ causing organisms can reside on instruments and devices used in patient care, leading to healthcare-associated infections or HAI. It is estimated that each year 1.7 million patients acquire infections in the healthcare facility that have nothing to do with their initial illness, and 98,000 patients or one in 17 die due to these HAIs.

HOW MICROORGANISMS ARE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED

There is a prescribed method for naming microorganisms. The first word in a microorganism's name is the genus, tribe or family, of the microorganism; the second word is the specific name of the organism, also called the species.

For example, *Pseudomonas can* cause infections in the blood, lungs (pneumonia) or other parts of the body after surgery. *Escherichia coli, or E. coli* can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, and pneumonia.

Microorganisms, like all living things, microorganisms, are identified and classified according to certain characteristics. Microorganisms can be broken down into two categories: bacteria and non-bacteria.

Bacteria

Characteristics

Bacteria are incredibly small-so small, in fact, that a microscope that can magnify at least 900 times is necessary to view them. Bacteria are measured by **microns** and most bacteria are one to two microns in size.

The most common ways to identify and classify bacteria are by shape, color change and oxygen needs **(aerobic** or **anaerobic).**

-   **Pathogen:** Capable of producing disease
-   **Micron:** 1/25,000 of an inch or 1/1,000 of a millimeter
-   **Aerobic:** Requiring the presence of air or free oxygen
-   **Anaerobic:** Bacteria that can live in the absence of atmospheric oxygen

Shape

The shape of bacteria is determined by cell wall structure. The common shapes of bacteria include:

-   **Spherical:** These bacteria are shaped like a circle or sphere (coccus). Examples include *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococci.*
-   **Rod:** shaped bacteria are shaped like rods or bricks (bacillus). Examples include *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Enterobacteria.*
-   **Spiral:** These bacteria are shaped like spirals (spirilla). *Helicobacter* is an example.

Certain bacteria can change into a different form, called **endospores (spores),** by developing a thick coal around the cell's nucleus when conditions required for growth are not adequate. These spores can become infectious and produce toxins once inside the body. For example, some spores (such as *Bacillus anthracic* that causes anthrax, and the *Clostridium* species that cause tetanus, botulism and severe diarrhea) are found in the soil, air and all over the body. Spores are highly resistant to disinfection and other conditions, such as heat, making them very difficult to kill.

-   **Endospores (spores):** Microorganisms capable of forming a thick wall around themselves, enabling them to survive in adverse conditions.

Color Change

Bacteria are typically clear and colorless organisms that cannot be seen unless they are dyed with a stain, allowing the shape of each individual organism to be viewed. There are two main types of staining processes used to identify the shapes and characteristics of bacteria.

-   **Gram staining,** a multi-step process using several stains and rinses, is used most frequently. The specimen is placed on a slide that is first stained purple with crystal violet; it is then stained with iodine, discolored using alcohol or acetone and, finally, stained with safranin.
-   **Gram stain:** Differential stain used to classify bacteria as gram positive or gram negative, depending on whether they retain or lose the primary stain (crystal violet) when subjected to a decolorizing agent.

Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that will not retain the purple stain after treatment with iodine; instead, they will stain pink.

Gram-positive bacteria have no outer membrane and will retain the purple stain, even if a decolorizer is used.

Some acid-fast bacilli are rod-shaped and very difficult to stain; however, once they are stained and heat or other agents are used, the bacteria will resist decolorization with a diluted acid-alcohol solution.

Need for Oxygen

Bacteria can also be classified according to whether they need oxygen to grow. Aerobic bacteria require oxygen, just as humans do. They may grow in liquids, but the liquid must have oxygen dissolved in it because oxygen is needed for respiration and metabolism.

On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, such as C. *tetani,* uses tetanus, must have oxygen eliminated from the environment in order to grow.

Suitable environments for bacteria are as diverse as the bacteria themselves. For example, a microbe that lives and thrives in the soil may not grow well in the vital organs of humans.

Suitable environments for bacteria can be broken down into nutritional needs, temperature, moisture/humidity, pH and light.

pH Measure of alkalinity or acidity on a scale of 0 to 14: with a pH of 6.5 – 7.5 being neutral (neither acid nor alkaline), pH below 6.5 is acid, pH above 7.5 is alkaline.

When tetanus bacteria are introduced deeply into the flesh by a nail or similar object, and when the nail is removed, the tissue closes the wound, oxygen is removed from the environment, and the anaerobic bacteria can grow.

Conditions Microorganisms Need to Grow and Reproduce

Groups of microbes have specific requirements for growth and survival. This tends to limit where they may be found.

Pathogenic bacteria are most likely to thrive where their specific nutritional needs can be met. Some can grow on and in many areas of the body, skin, blood and hair. Others, *are* more delicate and require a special environment, such as the mucous membranes of the reproductive system where they can live and invade deeper tissue.

Temperature requirements vary widely among bacteria as well. Some bacteria like cold temperatures (59°F to 68°F); some bacteria, like moderate temperatures, such as 68°F to l13°F; and others like warm temperatures of 122°F to l 58°F.

Moisture and relative humidity play a major role in the growth and survival of microorganisms. Microorganisms that inhabit skin, bacteria that produce spores, and TB bacillus can survive for years in a dry state. Some other species cannot survive for more than a brief period when subjected to complete dryness.

Except for bacteria used in the fermentation process (such as beer), most species will not grow in an acidic pH of 4.4 or lower. Pathogenic microorganisms have an optimal pH range of 7 to 7.8, the same pH as blood.

Dark conditions are favorable to the growth of bacteria, while sunlight is lethal to many organisms in their actively growing or **vegetative stage.** When spores of gram-positive bacilli are in a resting stage, they are most resistant to sunlight.

The most lethal light is ultraviolet light, which can be used, at the appropriate strength, to disinfect.

-   **Vegetative stage:** State of active growth of microorganisms (as opposed to the resting or spore stages).

Bacteria are transmitted primarily by the droplet route, contaminated water or food, direct contact through wounds, airborne mode, and/or by disease-carrying animals.

How Bacteria Grow

Under optimal conditions, microorganisms reproduce every 20 minutes (approximately) in a process called **binary fission.**

-   **Binary fission:** The typical method of bacterial reproduction in which a cell divides into two equal parts.

Multiple Drug-Resistant Organisms

In some cases, microorganisms adapt and change as a means of survival. For example, multiple drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) have become resistant to antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.

MDROs are increasingly found in hospitals, nursing homes and healthcare facilities of all sizes and are reducing the effectiveness of even the best antibiotics. Resistant pathogens can produce many types of infection in almost any body site.

Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus, or* MRSA, lives on the skin and is known to cause severe infections. Staph infections are spread by direct contact with an infected individual or by touching contaminated surfaces.

Vancomycin-resistant *Enterococci, or* VRE, lives in the bowels. This bacterium is transmitted when hands become contaminated from infected feces, urine or blood. It is also contracted by touching contaminated environmental surfaces.

Vancomycin-resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* causes pneumonia in susceptible humans. Strep is transmitted through direct contact with infected droplets from coughing or sneezing or from contact with other infected fluids. *Klebsiella* can be found on hands and in the intestinal tract. This bacterium causes pneumonia, nasal infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), wound, and bloodstream infections. *Klebsiella* is typically transferred through hand contact.

**Acinetobacter:** is normally found in soil, this bacterium can cause various illnesses ranging from pneumonia to serious blood or wound infections, and the symptoms vary depending on the disease.

**Acinetobacter:** can be resistant to many of today's antibiotics. It is transmitted by person-to­ person contact or by contact with contaminated surfaces.

**Pseudomonas aeruginosa:** is frequently found in water and in soil. *Pseudomonas* infections include UTIs, respiratory system infections, dermatitis, soft tissue infections, bacteremia, bone and joint infections, gastrointestinal infections, and a variety of systemic infections. *Pseudomonas* is transmitted through hand-to-hand contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.

**Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE):** are a family of germs that are difficult to treat because they have high levels of antibiotic resistance. *Klebsiella* species and E. coli are examples of *Enterobacteriaceae,* a normal part of the human gut bacteria that can become carbapenem resistant. CRE infections have been associated with devices such as flexible endoscopes and ventilators. Some CRE infections are very difficult to treat and can contribute to death in up to 50% of patients who become infected.

Non-Bacterial Microorganisms

Viruses

Viruses are the smallest microorganisms and are about 1,000 times smaller than bacteria. A virus enters a living plant or animal cell and reproduces itself within the cell. It usually destroys the cell, then enters another cell to survive. The virus itself has no means of movement and depends on air, water, insects, humans or other animals to carry it from one host to another.

In the healthcare setting, several bloodborne viral pathogens are of significance: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the most prevalent chronic bloodborne infection today, hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Viruses are transmitted primarily by the airborne or droplet route and include chickenpox (varicella), shingles (zoster), measles (rubeola), influenza and the common cold.

-   **The Ebola virus**: (or Ebola hemorrhagic fever) is a viral disease caused by the filovirus species. This virus is contracted by contact with blood or body fluids of an infected animal or human. The incubation period ranges from two to 21 days after exposure.

Like bacteria, some viruses can survive away from the host for many hours or days when in organic material such as scabs, blood and bodily waste. Some viruses, like the herpes simplex virus (HSV), can survive in a dry state for 1 ½ to four hours on toilet seats, up to 72 hours on cotton gauze, and 18 hours on plastic.

Standard cleaning protocols-with careful attention to cleaning processes-are usually sufficient to control these microorganisms.

Viruses transmitted by contaminated water or food include those that cause acute viral gastroenteritis such as rotavirus, Norovirus and Noro-like viruses. These often have symptoms similar to bacterial infections and spread through the four Fs: food, feces, fingers and flies. Another virus spread by food or water is hepatitis A, it is contracted by unwashed hands or eating raw or improperly cooked food.

Viruses that spread primarily by direct contact include cold sores (herpes labialis), genital herpes, genital warts, infectious mononucleosis, and rabies.

Viruses can also be transmitted through multiple routes: COVID-19 can be transmitted through direct contact, indirect contact, airborne and droplet routes.

Protozoa

**Protozoa**: are one-celled animal organisms that vary widely in size and shape and contain no cell walls.

Most protozoa live in moist habitats and are aerobic, but some species found in the human intestines are anaerobic. They are known for their ability to move independently, and some protozoa can form cysts and become pathogenic. Some protozoa may be spread by insects or direct contact.

The most frequently encountered pathogenic protozoa is Entamoeba listeria. It is found in feces, intestinal ulcers and liver abscesses of infected people.

**Cryptosporidium:** is another protozoan that can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. This organism can cause severe, life-threatening diarrhea in AIDS or cancer patients and organ transplant recipients.

Fungi

**Fungi** are a large group of plant-like organisms that include molds, mushrooms and yeasts. Fungi and bacteria are often found together in nature. While some fungi, such as yeast, occur as single cells that require a microscope to sec, others, such as mushrooms, are quite large.

The vegetative structure of a fungus varies widely in size, shape and complexity. Fungi (except for yeasts) are identified and classified by their shape and distribution of their reproductive structures. Most fungi are aerobic.

**Molds** are composed of many-celled organisms that typically grow in compact masses of intertwining, branching and hair-like filaments.

**Fungi have three major roles:**

1.  To turn dead organic matter into usable substances through decay and mildew
2.  To have a mutually symbiotic relationship with other organisms
3.  To be parasitic or pathogenic to plants or animals

**Fungi:** survive by feeding on living or dead organisms, and this process can be both beneficial and harmful. For instance, fermentation by fungi has been used for years to preserve food in places where refrigeration is unavailable. Fungi are necessary to produce bread, cheese, wine and beer, while other fungi, such as mushrooms, are used as food. Some fungi are used to produce pharmaceuticals, such as cortisone, the mold Penicillium Tatum that produces penicillin, as well as the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine. On the other hand, mold can produce toxins, spoil food and create illnesses.

Several fungus species can cause respiratory diseases in humans who acquire infections by inhaling spores from dust, bird droppings, soil and other sources.

Some fungi target the skin, hair, nails and mucosa! surfaces and are called superficial fungi. Common examples are ringworm of the scalp, athlete's foot, and candida, such as thrush and vulvovaginitis.

Prions

-   **Prions:** are abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins. Abnormal folding of the prion proteins leads to brain damage and the characteristic signs and symptoms of prion disease
-   **Prion:** An infectious protein particle that, unlike a virus, contains no nucleic acid, does not trigger an immune response, and is not destroyed by extreme heat or cold

**Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD** is a specific type of prion disease. It is rare that SP technicians in the U.S. receive instrumentation exposed to CJD, but when they do, they must know and apply proper processing procedures. In infected patients, prions are most frequently found in the brain, dura mater (the tough membrane that encases the nerves of the spinal cord) and eyes.

They are also detected less frequently in cerebrospinal fluid, the spleen, lymph nodes, kidney and liver. Seldomly, they are located in blood, urine, skin, muscle, bone, adrenal glands, heart, feces, peripheral nerves, nasal mucous, gingival, saliva, sputum, and tears.

When a suspected CJD patient undergoes a procedure, all healthcare professionals involved with that patient must be notified prior to the procedure, and the facility's CJD policies and procedures must be followed.

Cleaning and sterilizing items contaminated with prions is a challenge because prions are difficult to remove or deactivate and standard cleaning/ sterilization procedures are ineffective against prions. Whenever a suspected CJD case is scheduled, the following should be performed:

**Communication**

Inform the department's manager as soon as notification of a prion or potential prion procedure is received.

Immediately contact Infection Prevention and Control to determine which cleaning and sterilization guidelines will be followed at the facility. Currently, recommended guidelines are published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). Current guidelines are reviewed and updated as new knowledge regarding prions is gained.

**Instrumentation**

Due to the difficulty in cleaning and sterilization, disposable instruments should be used whenever possible when managing patients with prion disease. All current guidelines suggest disposing of reusable instruments that have become contaminated with high-risk tissue such as brain tissue, dura mater, spine and eye tissue. Reusable instruments will likely be damaged or completely destroyed during the stringent cleaning and sterilization protocols.

Heat and moisture sensitive items should not be used because they would likely be destroyed during cleaning and sterilization.

**Environmental surfaces**

Surfaces, such as countertops, that have become contaminated with prion material should be cleaned following the most current published protocols for CJD. Contaminated non-critical equipment should be cleaned following the most current published guidelines.

**CONTROLLING AND ELIMINATING MICROORGANISMS**

To prevent the spread of microorganisms that can cause disease, healthcare settings must practice microbial control. The Infection Prevention and Control and Sterile Processing departments are vital to microbial control and patient safety. Every time an instrument or device enters a patient's body during an invasive or minimally invasive procedure, there is a risk of infection.

It is important to remember that microorganisms can pose a significant threat to humans. One can compare microorganisms to seeds and draw some comparisons. There are many varieties of seeds, and each produces a different plant. Seeds must have the proper conditions to grow and continue living.

Those in a paper envelope at the store will not germinate and grow, however, when they are placed in the correct conditions with proper soil, water, fertilizer, warmth and sunlight they grow and develop. In the same manner, there are many varieties of microorganisms, and each can produce a specific effect such as an infection or disease when they have the proper conditions for growth and reproduction.

Microbial control is a complicated endeavor. Just as microorganisms differ in their needs for growth and reproduction, they also die at different rates. The type of microbial control used against an organism varies according to the microbes' susceptibility. Some pathogens are more difficult to kill than others, and that is one reason why disinfection and sterilization processes are so complex.

Microbial control can also depend on whether the goal is to kill a pathogen-causing infection through antibiotics, inactivate or kill microorganisms on the skin through antisepsis or-in the case of SP-kill pathogens on medical instruments or devices that will be used on patients.

In addition to microbial susceptibility, the vast array of items that must be processed is another reason no single disinfection or sterilization process can kill all microorganisms.

SP technicians should be able to recognize the conditions that favor the growth of microorganisms in the workplace.

**CONCLUSION**

Having a basic understanding of the principles of microbiology and learning about bacterial and non-bacterial organisms and how they can be transmitted helps SP technicians understand the important role they play in eradicating microorganisms and preventing infection.
