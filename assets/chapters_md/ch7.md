INTRODUCTION

Reusable instruments and other medical devices processed in the Sterile Processing department the (SPD). Are transported to patient care and treatment areas where they are used in a wide variety of procedures and applications. After use, they must be transported back to the decontamination area to be processed for reuse. Sometimes, the transport distance is only a few feet, but other items may need to be transported a great distance between facilities. Whether the distance is only a few feet between the user department and the SPD or a long distance between facilities, consistent handling of soiled instruments is a must. This chapter reviews recommended protocols and requirements for these transportation activities.

**IMPORTANCE OF POINT-OF-USE TREATMENT AND TRANSPORT**

**Sterile Processing, the (SP):** should be aware of the goals of point-of­ use treatment and transport.

**These include:**

-   **Removal of gross soil.** Any Gross soil left on instruments will make it a lot more difficult to clean, and may even damage the instrumentation being processed.
-   **Prevention of damage.** All Soiled items must be treated in a manner that will prevent damage not just during the point of use processing, but also during transportation to the decontamination area of the SPD.
-   **Prevention of cross-contamination.** All Soiled items must be safely transported from point-of-use to the decontamination area, without cross-contaminating the environment between those areas.
-   **Timeliness.** Prompt return of soiled and contaminated items to the SPD, is essential for cleaning and processing. Items returned on time to the SPD will not only shorten the turnaround time but will also add to the quality of good patient careservices.
-   **Keeping others safe**. All Soiled items must be labeled and contained in such a way that ensures safety of all individuals who may come in contact with those contaminated items, intentionally or unintentional contact. All parties must remain safe during the transportation process which must include all Hospital employees, visitors and vendors.

**Examples of Gross soil are,** Tissue, body fat, blood and other bodily fluids or substances.

SOURCES OF CONTAMINATED ITEMS

Reusable medical devices, such as instruments and equipment, are used in numerous locations throughout the healthcare facility. The Surgery department generates a high volume of contaminated items, but other ancillary areas such as Labor & Delivery, the Emergency Department, Endoscopy, Cardiac Care Services and other procedure-based areas also generate contaminated items.

Although ancillary users of instrumentation may not generate the same volume as surgical departments, it is extremely important that users of reusable instrumentation receive focused education and training prior to instrument pretreatment and transport activities.

In many facilities, the SP decontamination area is located close to the Operating Room, the OR. That is the logistical location because surgery is the source of most soiled items transported to the SPD. Enclosed carts filled with contaminated instruments, equipment and utensils can be easily, quickly and safely transported to the decontamination area through a connecting hallway. If the SPD is located on another level of the facility, items can be transported between floors using a dedicated elevator or dumbwaiter system used exclusively to transport contaminated items.

In some healthcare systems, the SPD is centralized to one facility, requiring the contaminated instrumentation to be transported by vehicles. or a dedicated elevator used to transport contaminated items.) When using dedicated elevators or dumbwaiters to transport contaminated items, facilities should establish routine cleaning schedules and procedures.

Contaminated items may be returned to the SP decontamination area during scheduled soiled pick-up rounds or upon request from a user department. Sometimes, soiled items may be delivered to the decontamination area by employees of the user department. For example, surgical staff return case carts to the decontamination area after surgical procedures. Generally, however, contaminated items are placed in a designated holding area to be picked up by SP technicians at designated times.

Holding Items Until Return to Sterile Processing

All departments that use and store reusable items for later transport to the Sterile Processing department need a designated holding area for contaminated items until they can be retrieved. These areas should be clearly designated with **biohazard signage** and should not be accessible to visitors or other unauthorized personnel. The contaminated holding area should have contaminated trash, linen receptacles, sharps container, a dedicated handwashing sink, and personal protective equipment PPE, available.

-   **Biohazard signage are** Notices posted in easily seen locations, in an easy to see and understand format, that should alert people in that area about the presence of harmful bacteria, viruses or other dangerous biohazardous agents or organisms.

POINT-OF-USE TREATMENT

Instrument decontamination begins at the point of use. When the procedure is complete, instruments should be prepared in a manner that will help to ensure that they can be transported safely to the SP decontamination area for complete cleaning. SP professionals must enlist the help of user departments to ensure that instruments and equipment are correctly prepared for the decontamination process immediately after use. Some facilities have SP technicians assigned to the OR to assist with instrument setup and breakdown, so it is important to know proper point-of­ use instrument handling.

Reasons for Point-of-Use Treatment

-   There are several important reasons that the point-of-use treatment process should begin in the user department (at the point of use):
-   Point-of-use treatment helps prolong instrument life. Common substances to which instruments are exposed during procedures, such as blood and saline, can breakdown devices' protective finish and accelerate decomposition.
-   Dry soil and debris, especially in instruments with lumens and hard-to-reach crevices, are much more difficult to remove than moist soil and debris.
-   Soil and excess moisture promote the formation of **biofilm colonies**. **Biofilm** is highly resistant to cleaning and disinfecting chemicals. removing the causes of biofilm, as well as removing Biofilm/Bioburden is essential to keeping any environment clean and healthy.
-   **Biofilm, is** A collection of microorganisms that attach to surfaces and each other and form a colony. These colonies produce a protective gel that helps keep the colony safe and protected from outside sources of danger. These colonies are 200 times more difficult to clean and penetrate with detergents and disinfectants than microbes not protected by this gel.

When soil dries, instruments require more aggressive cleaning methods, and instruments with dried soil also take longer to clean.

The proper care and handling of instruments and equipment is the responsibility of everyone who comes in contact with them, and that begins with personnel at the point of use.

Personnel responsible for handling instruments at the point of use must keep in mind that those instruments are precision devices that can have a negative impact on patient care if not managed properly. Instruments should be handled with care throughout the procedure and be prepared properly for transport according to facility policy.

Point-of-Use Treatment Guidelines

Point-of-use treatment does not replace the cleaning process; instead, its purpose is to begin the cleaning process through precleaning and preparation activities. The following guidelines should be followed when users prepare items for transport to the SP decontamination area:

All individuals performing point-of-use treatment should receive education, training and have competencies completed for the task being performed.

Remove gross soil from instruments. Wear appropriate PPE while preparing instruments for transport.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions for point-of-use treatment, which can include pre-cleaning and preparation activities.

Separate reusable **sharps** from other instruments. Place instruments with sharp points or edges, such as cutting edges and skin hooks, in a separate container to reduce the risk of injuries from sharps.

**Sharps are considered any** Cutting, dissecting, penetrating or slicing instruments. They are further separated into 2 categories: Single use and Reusable sharps. Single use sharps may include knives, saws, burs, scalpel blades, needles, sutures, staples, screws, pins and some scissors. Reusable sharps may include: chisels, osteotomes, curettes, dissectors, elevators, ronguers, cutting forceps, punches, trocars, scissors and skin hooks.

Protect delicate instruments from damage during transport by segregating them into different containers or placing them on top of heavier instruments.

Separate reusable linen. Reusable linen should be removed and placed into an appropriate bag or container. Users should take extra caution to ensure that small instruments are not mistakenly included with the linen.

Remove disposable components, such as blades, disposable tubing and canisters. Sharp items should be placed in a hard-sided container labeled biohazard. Separating disposable from reusable components reduces the amount of contaminated items that must be transported, and it also reduces the risk of injury from sharps such as knife blades and needles.

When separating disposable items, watch closely to ensure that reusable items such as metal drape clamps, are not removed and discarded with disposable components.

Open hinged instruments, disassemble multi-part instruments, and place instruments in the appropriate instrument tray in an orderly manner. Opening and disassembling instrumentation allows pre-treatment solutions to reach all areas of the instrument. Place heavy instruments on the bottom of the tray, with lighter instruments on top. Handle cords, endoscopes and cameras with care. Do not place any items on top of them. The SPD should be notified if some instruments are not being returned with the set for any reason.

Keep items together. Instrument sets or multi-part items should be kept together for their transport to the SP decontamination area. If items are separated or left behind, reassembly will be delayed. Failure to keep items together also increases the risk that components will be misplaced or lost. Keep instruments moist to prevent soil from drying on their surface. This can be accomplished by using commercial foams, gels or spray products, or placing a water-moistened towel over them.

**Note**: If instruments are placed in a soak basin or solution, they should not be exposed to the solution for an extended period of time because this may damage the instruments' surface. Review manufacturers' instructions for use (IFU) for recommended soaking times. The soaking solution must be discarded before transport to reduce the risk of spills. Care should be taken not to contaminate the outside of the tray or container:

Working Smarter, Not Harder

When there are big cases that require multiple instrument sets, keeping instruments together in the same set can be a challenge. Why is this important? Consider that in a busy decontamination department that processes50or60surgical procedures a day, there can be hundreds of trays processed. If instrumentation from one case is scattered between four different trays in the OR, it can be several hours before each tray is cleaned and makes its way to the assembly side of the SPD.

On the assembly side, the time spent looking for and sorting out instrumentation can slow down productivity and be a frustrating process. Finding a process to keep instrumentation together prior to receipt in decontamination can help improve productivity and employee satisfaction.

Empty fluids from containers. If a contaminated device has a reusable fluid container, bottle or receptacle, the fluid should be removed and disposed of according to the facility's protocols. Disposable fluid containers should also be handled according to required facility procedures.

Third-party reprocessing items should be removed and properly contained or separated and sent to the SPD per facility protocols.

If reusable instruments were used during a case with suspected or known Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the surgical team must notify SP and Infection Prevention and Control departments immediately. Follow hospital procedures for initial cleaning and containment for transport to the SP decontamination area. Please note that the CDC might also have to be notified and reports created.

Notify the SPD about items needing repair. If instruments or equipment require repair, they should be identified or tagged, so they can be removed from service and sent for repair or refurbishing.

Notify the SPD about items requiring **turnover or turnaround trays needed** for another case. Do not automatically assume the department has this information.

-   **Turnover or turnaround, is a** Term used to describe instruments or equipment that must receive priority reprocessing in order to be made available for another procedure immediately or shortly after they are finished being used.

SP professionals must work together with end users to ensure that point-of-use treatment is carried out according to manufacturers' IFU. In many cases, departments will need to develop joint procedures for the handling of used items to ensure that everyone involved understands their role in the process.

TRANSPORT OF SOILED ITEMS

Contaminated items should be contained before transport through the facility to minimize airborne or contact spread of microorganisms and reduce the risk of cross contamination and infection. The best way to transport soiled instruments is in enclosed carts. If an open transport cart is used, the cart must have a solid bottom shelf to prevent drips and spills, and the cart must be covered during transport.

Smaller numbers of instruments from other departments can be transported in dedicated transport containers or in plastic bags that are clearly labeled biohazard. Large items, such as suction units and other types of patient care equipment, can be transported in special carts designed for soiled item transport.

The goal of all soiled transport is to transfer the contaminated items to the SP decontamination area while minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. All transport devices must be free from external gross contamination, such as blood, before transport to reduce the risk of environmental contamination and personnel exposure. Contaminated items should be handled as little as possible to reduce the risk of exposure to employees and patients.

Place instrument sets securely in the cart. Sets should be placed so they do not slide or fall during transport. Metal trays and containers should not be placed on top of more fragile plastic trays and containers. Do not mix unopened sterile and soiled instruments in the same cart because this will contaminate sterile items.

Personnel transporting contaminated items should be educated, which includes training and competencies, and must consistently follow safe handling procedures. These include methods to safely load transport devices to avoid spillage and to ensure items are securely contained.

When transporting instruments, contaminated items should remain physically separated from their clean and sterile counterparts. Containers and earls used for transporting contaminated items should not be used to transport and deliver clean items, unless they are thoroughly decontaminated between use. Surgical case carts used to transport soiled instruments from surgery to the decontamination area must be decontaminated before they can be used to transport sterile packages back to surgery.

Ideally, soiled devices will be transported to the SP decontamination area immediately after use. This reduces the opportunity for soil to dry on the instruments. The longer instruments remain unclean the greater the risk for biofilm formation. Returning instruments quickly allows the items to be returned to service in a timely manner.

Contaminated items from other departments are often placed in a holding area for pickup on a scheduled basis by SP technicians who then return them to the decontamination area for processing. These soiled pick-up rounds should be conducted as scheduled because failure to perform soiled item pickups can lead to equipment and instrument shortages. All healthcare facilities have limited numbers of instrument sets and patient care equipment. The instrument and equipment replenishment system relies on items moving through the system in a timely manner.

SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR SOILED ITEM TRANSPORT

All instruments, utensils and equipment used in patient care and treatment processes should be considered contaminated. SP technicians who transport contaminated items should wear appropriate PPE. After loading the cart, PPE should be removed, and hands should be washed.

Transporting equipment and carts through corridors can pose significant safety concerns. SP technicians must always maintain control of transport carts and should not move them at excessive speeds.

Patients, visitors, healthcare providers and movable equipment share the same hallways as transport carts, and excessive speed or inattention could lead to accidents. SP technicians should maintain control of their carts and pay particular attention to hallway intersections and doors that may open into the path of the cart. Many facilities install safety mirrors at hallway junctions to help prevent accidents. Carts containing soiled items should never be left unattended.

In addition to maintaining safe control of their transport carts, SP technicians should always yield to patients and visitors in hallways and at elevators. In any healthcare facility, the routine transport of soiled items never takes precedence over the transport of patients.

Prior to transporting, SP technicians should be aware of ergonomic principles. Completing tasks that require lifting, bending, twisting, pushing and pulling incorrectly can cause injury. Applying ergonomic principles can help technicians avoid workplace injuries such as **musculoskeletal disorders** that cause back pain, tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and even bone fractures.

-   **Musculoskeletal disorders, are any** Injuries or disorders of the muscles, nerves, tendons. joints, cartilage or spinal discs.

OFF-SITE PROCESSING

Sometimes, contaminated items may need to be transported between buildings or to a central off-site processing center. When it is necessary to transport contaminated items using a truck or van, facility personnel must consult U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines and follow applicable state and local requirements for the safe transport of biohazard materials.

When preparing items for off-site transport, care should be taken to protect the instruments from damage during transport. Instruments should be placed in their containers in a manner that will shield the instruments from movement that could lead to damage. Instrument trays should be placed securely in a transport cart, which can then be secured inside the transport vehicle to prevent accidental spills or contamination.

A clear separation of clean and dirty should be established. Instruments should be transported as soon as possible after the procedure to reduce the risk of the soil drying, which makes instruments more difficult to clean.

**Policies and procedures should be defined to address the following:**

-   **Route and road conditions**.
    -   The quickest and safest route should be established.
-   **Temperature and humidity.**
    -   Extreme temperatures and humidity can contaminate sterile supplies or degrade packaging prematurely
-   **Separation of clean and dirty.**
    -   Well defined boundaries must be established to separate clean and dirty items to prevent cross contamination.
-   **Establish cleaning procedures.**
    -   Routine cleaning of the vehicle should be performed after transporting soiled items
-   **Education, training and competencies.**
    -   All individuals involved in transporting activities must be educated and have competencies kept on file

EDUCATION AND TRAINING

When performed improperly, the transport of contaminated items can pose a threat to the safety of patients, visitors and employees. Carefully thought-out procedures must be developed to help ensure that all contaminated items are appropriately handled. The development of these procedures should be done with the input and support of the facility's Infection Prevention and Hazardous Materials committees.

Recommended practices for contaminated item transport are provided by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation or (AAMI). Procedures should also reflect Occupational Safety and Health Administration or (OSHA) regulations. Additional information regarding soiled instrument treatment and transport can be obtained from the Association for periOperative Registered Nurses (A O R N).

Anyone who may have contact with contaminated items must be educated about the dangers associated with biohazardous items. In addition to education and training for SP technicians, Environmental Services employees, courier and transport technicians and drivers should be included in education pertaining to transport and handling of contaminated items. This education should include proper handling of biohazardous items and the correct application and use of PPE.

CONCLUSION

Instrument point-of-use treatment and proper transport to the SPD requires interdepartmental teamwork. Good communication and training can help personnel in all departments protect their facility's instruments and better serve patients. By understanding and following the recommended guidelines for the point-of-use treatment and transport of contaminated items, SP technicians help protect patients, visitors and healthcare workers.
